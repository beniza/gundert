Mrs Gundert

 Kaity 10 Aug 54
My dear wife

What a length of time you left me without letter. I hope you now understand all about the journey. Friday the 18th the horse ought to be in Tanoor, ready to march back to Calicut on Saturday. - Mrs B. will stay a week in Calicut and some days at Chomb and Tell. - Mrs Lascelles is glad about Jesuad<ial>* as well as her father who consents. I bring 10 Rs for her to commence house keeping. I have excused you with the Lady. - MÃ¶glg is now on his road to Bangalore. I am sorry for Francis and Joseph they are very much in the dark and after so many warnings there is little hope for them at present

Now farewell - Love to the Children, to whom I hope soon to write  Your HG
