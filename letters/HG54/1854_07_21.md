My dear wife

Just now I arrived at Albr's, whose child is still in danger - she is better but altogether there is little hope of their staying here to any purpose. Mrs B. has not as yet come to any resolution. I have succeded however in setting the sale of things agoing Dobbie helped kindly. yesterday evening I came up with him, greeted wife and Hodgson's, saw Dr Scudder and fought with him, for he attacked our Committee furiously for stinginess and the brethren Albr and Metz have helped to increase the general dissatisfaction raised by their proceedings. - You will be glad to hear better news of Herm. I send them at once. The things were delayed by being directed to Paulghaut. - I think the Comm. must send Moer. up here, and the best would be, if they did at once put the whole work of the Station another footing. Otherwise I fear there will be little gain from the labor done here. Send Jette's letter to Pauline Weigle - won't you? and write perhaps a line for Herm.

You will have heard that S MÃ¼ller will leave the Mission. Br Hamberg in China is dead. Mrs Stanger had Cholera in April. - Now farewell 
 Love to all
 Your HGdt
