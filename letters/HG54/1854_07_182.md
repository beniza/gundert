 [18th July] <17/7 54>1

My dear Paul.

This is the 18th July a Tuesday as was the day when I left you, and now I am on the hills, all full of roses and sweet smelling flowers around me. Only fancy in Coimbatore I saw a little tiger like a large cat, but broader head and thicker legs and his ears standing stiff - it was led about with a chain and a lady played with it. I also saw two Neelgays - what is that? and some spotted deer. Now I stand behind your Monsoon. When I go to Kaety perhaps I run a little into it. In Coimbatore it was very strong wind, all from the Malabar coast and the hills, and there come now and then drops out of the wind - though you see no rain falling any where near, but the wind carries such drops very far. I am sure you have enough rain at present. Don't run out so much; mind what Mama says and pray also for little Sophie, who now has no Papa on earth. This evening I hope to see her and will ask her if she would like to come and play with you all. With love to yourself, brothers and Mimies
 Your father.
