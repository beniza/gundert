 <Aug 54>*

Dear Paul

As you wish it, I also wish to come back soon and be with you all. But you know, in this world we can not do all we wish. It would be wrong, because God often wishes something better for us than we wish, and it would be very foolish, to think our wish better and grumble for it. Sophie is now quite well and plays. But she does not like me, because I several times had to give medecine to her. Then she cried repeatedly "Don't want Gundert" and therefore goes rather to Mama or the servants. Sophie has a doll which can open and shut her eyes. If she comes down, this wonderful baby will accompany her: you will wonder when you see it. Now good bye and be an obedient and diligent boy! Selam to Charles!
 Your Papa
