Dear Madam

<Tagbuch: Pierre Schmidt mit Mttr besuchen wegen Heirat?>*
I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 18th May, and can only in answer to it express my regret, that your Son should have indulged a wish, for the realization of which I see no prospect I can not well enter upon a discussion concerning the nature of my connexion with the girls brought up in my family, or the kind of hopes that I may entertain for them: but I can assure you that I have well considered your proposal, and have come to the conviction that it is my duty to decline it. Trusting that you will take this answer in good part and hoping that your search for a companion to your Son will end in a manner truly satisfactory to you all I remain  D M
 yours faith
