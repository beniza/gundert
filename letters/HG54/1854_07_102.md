My dear Young

I send you the enclosed letters which report of our Br BÃ¼hler's last day on earth. The Lord be praised for all!

It is my intention to propose to Br Hebich and Diez, without delay to visit the Nilgherries. Of course if Br Hebich is ready to go I remain. But I think he will at all events stay some weeks longer. Would you kindly ask Sandeman, at what time's notice bearers for a Manjil might be posted to Calicut, and send the answer with the enclosed notes mine Drews and Stanes* to Hebich

 Yours affly
 H Gundert
