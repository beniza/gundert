My dear wife

I will just make an end to our correspdce by writing once more from the first spot in Malabar. On Monday abt noon we left Kaity, just the 4th birthday of Sophie, passed the night in Stanes' house which is the one lowest down the Ghaut, went off next noon, increased by one palankeen more, that of Mrs Leslie, who being afraid for her husbd, wishes to meet him at Cann and puts herself under my protection. Rather an anxious affair, as there was no time to order bearers beforehand. However we got down - Mrs B. very late on acct of her Badaga bearers, and I on Woodfall's horse had to stay by her and urge the fellows on. In Metupalyam tea, then off, Mrs Leslie and self in 2 bandies, Mrs B. in palanqu. Passed Wednesday at Coimbatore in Thomas' house. Addis seems a little displeased with us. I wrote a note to appease him. Off in the evening again in bandies! Mrs Leslie's palanq. has not as yet reached. Arrived with a little rain in the middle of the road at Palghaut. 1st Mrs B with Sophie, the latter quite intimate with Thomas, when we arrived 8 1/2 - Mrs L. still very nervous and excited. Nothing as yet settled with regard to bearers. The Cutwal tries however. Mr Knox the Coll. is at Coimb. where I saw him and was much pleased at once. Haultain sends breakfast etc. Dr Porteus also promises to visit. Now I trust somehow or other the Lord will help us on. With love to yourself and Bava's
 Yours HG
