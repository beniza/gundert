1Dear Sir

It is about a year ago that Mrs Martin wished for some table clothes and other work, which I ordered for her at our establishmt at Mangalore. The articles were by her desire sent to Ottacamund. But neither was their reception acknowledged nor the bill paid. As I suppose Mrs Martin may have gone to some other place I take the liberty of addressing to you the enclosed memorandum of our head weaving at Mang. establishment, and asking you if you would kindly remit the amount, that is - adding the price of some edgings, made at our school (12 As) - the sum of
 Rs 48.9.10-
