Sir

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th of this month. You ask me whether during my residence in Malabar I have heard of instances of torture being employed for the purpose of realizing the revenues of the state. In answer I have to state that during the 15 years I resided on this coast no such instance has ever come to my knowledge. As the Malayalis are not accustomed to suffer silently but generally make the most even of trifling complaints, I conclude from their silence that such practices have not been heard by them: and I am confirmed in this view by the fact, that tho' I have not often come into contact with Southern Malayalis (from Travancore) yet have I repeatedly heard them complain of various tortures being <had recourse to> in the collection of their pepper by the native government and they invariably wound up the tale of their grievances with the fervent wish, that the Company might soon take possession of their unhappy country.
