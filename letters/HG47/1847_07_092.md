My dear Mrs Gundert

I hope that you improved in health and be able to return soon. Frederich is growing on well he laughs, and plays, his head is stronger, and lifts it up, and likes to sit very much, but he is not yet able; Miss Kegel says after tow or three weeks he may sit. I worked a cap, and am working a pair of stockings for baby. My sister is now with me. The nurse, Dorcas, and her mother, Margeret, all the girls, seand there salms.

 Your's devadet

1Rather than let this letter go halfempty I will write some words upon it. I have this week been in Vadagara and Chombala the first was this time rather difficult because of Jacob, who makes debts and does no work. In Chomb. there is a happy spirit much prayer, union and peace in the Lord. Marie, Matthai's wife asks for baptism. So does a sister in law of Timothy in Mahe; we have hopes for both of them. You ask about Pakr I do not know what to say. He is not spiritual, whatever else he may be, and therefore we must not give up the care for him. But he seems happy with his wife and has taken all the fault of his doings upon himself. His friendship with Mark appears to be very close. But who can give the spirit but God? - Arabella with Nath. is happy enough. I like him as servant. Perhaps he will have to accompany me in that capacity when I visit the hills after Monsoon.
