Daer papa.

Though I send you a letter on Saturday <9 Oct>* I will now add a few lines. I hope this will reach you before the Greiners leave Caliut and so you will be able to send me what I have asked to Marie;

just now it is very pleasant here very littl rain, now and then frost early the morning. Miss Robert an assistant of Miss Hale, has spent yesterday here. she pleases me better than the two others, she was the best friend of Flora Brennen She says that Flora very often read the Bible, and had marked many places with had strucked her, during her illness she got Miss Rober to read; but as soon as Miss Hales entered the room she took the book from her and would let her know that she was hearing the Bible, she was not open at all with Miss H. She sometimes told Miss R. that she hoped God would give her grace to be a blessing to her father over whom she morned some times. Poor Miss H<ale>* seems to be much taken up with the great people. Now I must bid you farewell, as I am biginning the lessons with the children. 
 Yours aff
 Julie G.

Monday <(11)>*. I now recieve your letter I have joy for you but: what am I? where am I? for my sins perhaps could I not be present with you; to all joy, but what to me! Do you truly pray for me?

You have come to a right way with H. this is what I wanted confession and prayer, but what to me? Am I cut off from all those blessings?
