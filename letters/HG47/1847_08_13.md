My dear wife

I have not received this week any letter from the hills but it may be the fault of the Tappal, and hope that nothing is the matter with you, as the world says, or better that our Lord keeps you in a steady way of recovery in body and soul. I send you Theodor's letter, which I have answered - also Strange's to whom I excused you and wrote all the news, so you need not trouble yourself about it. - Marie, the ...ttle <little>*1 niece of Paul in Chombala was already ... <since(?) some>* weeks in her home, on account of _...l <real (?)>* bad health - the Lord has taken her ... <home>* on Monday (9 Aug) and I arrived just in ...b <Chomb>* to bury her. Silas wife on the other ...d <hand>* was confined of a boy 2 days after. <We>* are going on slowly but steadily, the ... <Lord>* is on our side - he purifies us but _...t <does not>* cast away. In a week more we ... <shall>* have home letters. Time seems to pass ...e quickly enough. Frederick is looking up and becomes stout and herrisch. When I have him I must walk, talk, sing etc as soon as I sit he orders me off. Grace be with you! My love to the Weigle's Bühler and Mörike

 Yours affly
 H Gdt
