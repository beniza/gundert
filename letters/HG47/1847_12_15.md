Sir1,

Being for a while here in Mr Hebich's place during his visit to Mangalore and seeing that he delays to return, I think it my duty meanwhile to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th Dec. and to state that Mucwen Govinden, a youth of 20 years has already on the 8th Dec. on his own accord returned to his relations, after the complaint brought by them against him of having made away with some property of Coottan had been dismissed by the Ameen as unfounded. As he now is living in great harmony with the mother and his cousin Coottan having given up all connection with the Mission, you my perhaps judge it unnecessary for Mr Hebich to enter into further explanations of the circumstances connected with Moccwatty Ayah's petition
