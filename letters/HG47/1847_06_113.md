Mlle Kegel â€¦ elle seule

 <11 Juni 1847.>*

Well dear Marie <Kegel>*, for yourselves.

You are determine not to write to me till you have heard of me. But what shall I say, till a few days ago I was the very same even worse, and now that I was nicely I have been made very unhappy, in hearing that the food of the nurse has been changed again when it was going on so well with the dear babe. Now tell me what is the matter. Is it Mrs I faults? If she is not quite willing to give from the godown what is necessary for the nurse food. My husband will give you money and Canan shall buy at Tellichery all what is wanted. Chifly during the rain she should be fed at Nettoor, because it is too far off and it shall be often that she comes to night without any food. And who feels it but my poor child and you. Now I pray spare nothing. Please to loock every day at the food of the nurse before she eats it, command that it be brought to you to see it.

I have been asking many times how he spleeps, how he eats, if he is getting some flesh, but to all these no unseur. I am told that he laughs, but what that, he may laughs just wen his papa takes him and yet be unwell. Now I adjure you write me and the very day you recieve this. You are not well this I know, but this is not the reason of your silence I am sure 
 Adieu dear Marie
 be not engrey
 with Your aff
 J Gundert
