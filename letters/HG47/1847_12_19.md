Dear papa.

It is again as you see, a very small note; though I have no excuse to give for it. Moerike is very nicely all hopes that he may be quite cured. Buhler not quite so well. he is expected to spend here Christmass. Mogling it seems is writing here not so often as he did.

Thanks for the newspaper in Malayalam. Tell me in your next how it has been with the visit of H at Mangalore <vom 7 - 16. Dec.>* and how you have spent this feast.

Dea Christianaly's birthday is soon at hand. have you written to your parents this month? Moerike I like every day more and more. Buhler is a piculiar friend of Cassamajor. Frank G<roves>* has been on the hills, but I have not seen him. The letter of Arthur I have sent to Hanny as Groves is at Madras. Have you given my thanks to brother Irion for his remembering me before God? How is Caroline Muller and he too?

today a year ago I left my parents, to go to Neuchatel, then to BÆ’le how many recolections for a fainted heart! I hope you have letters in the way, home letters too, If you have a nice book to join to the parcel I have sent for Marie give her. it will please her to have some what from you. I hope she will like the dress I have sent down. Give also some what to Isabella. 
Please to put a wofeur to the note of Marie before you give it her 
 Yours J Gundert.

PS. Mrs. Lascelles sends you regards in the same way the all house. Give my love to all
