 <11 Novbr 49>*

My dear papa

Sunday <11 Nov>* I just recieve a letter from Mrs Cummin she speaks of her joye of having seen you and tells me that soon you will be quite well. May our heavenly father greant it so to his Glory.

People here are praying that you may return in good health and that they may hear you for the profit of their souls. The little girls as well as the other have learned to pray as if the sheapherd had been punished for the flock this they know from Catechists. however may we all understand what the Lord ... by his dealings and in hope humble ourselves for in due time the promise shall be fuflilled. I was much taken up today by the words of James about sick people. is it not from unbelief that we do not follow it and also disobedience. Had Luther come* right to think that James Epistle is not as well word of God as the other portions*? Mrs C has been it seams blessed through you Give her my love and thanks for this last letter of her.

We are all well thank God and looking towards Saturday with great joye and perhaps shall go to meet you at Can. With love from all and to all  Yours aff
