Lieber Alter

Plenty of Selams to you and all. I got yours of the 19th Sunday evening nothing as yet from my wife - the cake has been duly handed over to me to the Buhler's and Möglg with watchmakers and is now dispatched from their table. Ebenez is full of good cheer. Gnan finds it difficult to get rice - so dear - shoes he bought this morning. He stares at the watch making and other businesses. NB. What a strange story. On the day of his arrival Jeremiah when shown some work gave his opinion how it ought to have been done and the next day said concerning every thing he saw how it might be made better, so clever a bookbinder he was then - he has since fallen a little - similar is one of the watchmakerapprentices "I know already to put a watch asunder and together" yes but then it does not go! - Mrs. Cummin wrote a short note which I answered and sent Gn over. Anderson I saw for a momt on Sunday

I find it rather noisy - and am doubtful if with Stanger's arrival I ought not to go down to the Greiners'. The Dr is sick and not to be seen. - Well love to wife and children - Friederick I hope is a good boy and Vau faithful to his bottle and smiles - Mit herzlichem Gruß an Alle
 Dein HG.
