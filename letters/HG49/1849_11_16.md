My dear Mrs West

I hope I shall be able tomorrow to send you the musters of lace which we are making. they are with Mrs Young it is the reason I do not send them now, but as soon as I have them I shall send them together with the Antimacassars* we have at last finished for you.

We shall be very happy to see you with Mrs Banson any day of the next week <kamen am 22 Novb 49 Donn>*. As it may be too fatiguing for Mrs B. to come and return in the afternoon. we shall be very happy of your spending the day if Mrs B can put up with our rural style of life.

With our united kind regards Believe me
Dear Mrs West
 Yours afftly
