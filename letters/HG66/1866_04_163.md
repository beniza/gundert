Dear Frederic

Pardon that I have so long not written, how not ansewred about the wash. but you will have found that you have still plenty in Stutgart; for I have here but three shirts of yours.

You will have to send your wash in a week the 23d by Bauer. I am glad to hear that Mama and Caroline come to us for the Mission feast, tell also please Elisabeth Isenberg that I thank her for her kind letter and wait for her visit with Mama and C. Hearty love to Tante Anna and to all the people. 
Pardon haste from yours
 J.G
