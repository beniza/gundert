My dear Frederic

Before all I must beg you to be so kind and send me for a sexer Gichtpapier, I wish to see whether it is better than here, for some years Mutter had sent me some which was very nice green; it is not for me, 
You should not be troubled about speaking or not, let yourself be led quietly by the Lord He will tell you when you are to speak one makes to oneself lows and duties which make us often unhappy, pray the Lord to guide you, force not your way; but be obedient to the spirit of the Lord, you have to do with the Lord and not with men, loock upon him, wait when you have prayed upon his unswer; We are curious people that I feel for myself, how much patience must my Lord have with me. I forget so soon that I have to do with him alone, that I should continually hear his woice and follow him.

Adieu dear Freddy pray much you shall get much
 yours J.G
