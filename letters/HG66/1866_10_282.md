My dear Frederic

I hope that you have to day a good day, that you in Church and specially in God's word found food and blessings.

We were as usual in Hirsau papa had the 10th of John spoke of the good shepherd and of the sheep. papa is not quite well it is perhaps a catarrh he is yet in JÃ¼nglings Verein. The letter of Paul will give you joy, to see how the Lord is gracious to him and helps him to confess His name which is a mittle to keep us alive, and more watchful, and prayful; be of Good courage God will also help you to die to self and confess His name 
How are all the dear people in your house? I hope that you have much to do! When is Nast going? poor young man I am sorry for him. You have much to thank the Lord who has led you so mercifully hitherto I must pray daily for me and my children the portion of the Lord's prayer, "lead us not into temptation deliver us from evil. idelness in watching and praying is the cause that we fall into temptation!

Adieu dear Son I wish you a good time
 yours J. Gundert
