Dear Frederic.

It was very nice that you gave to dear papa so a nice Gravat. I thank you too for the soap. kindly let me know what it costs, it is very nice. You did not see much of papa during his stay there? Well you may write to us. So now you have soupe the morning I think it is healthyer for you than Coffee specially that you took too much Coffee and too little milk. You will soon be accustomed to soupe. God uses often our health to teach us good lessons; when we are obliged to abstain from things we like; but be sure He has always a blessing for us in store if we without murmur submit taking that which comes as from him direct. if not one hair of our head fall without his will, how much more the different pains and sickness we have. Tell us all about you dear Frederic. I miss your letters very much, formerly I had some lines to read; but now nothing, be open and confident towards us, you know we love you dearly. love us too

Adieu dearest Frederic
 Yours J.G.

love from Louise
