My dear Frederic

Your last has given me much joy; the Lord be praised for his faithfulness and love to youward. Yes one has a good time with such a merciful Saviour, He does not deal like men. yesterday in the preaching, it was said why one has no hunger and thirst; a man who works well has appetite so it is in spiritual. if we give witness to that which we have heard, and do works of love, we get new wants after fresh food and strength; but if we are inactive idle; then there is also no want of new supply. It is certainly the case, Why are so many Christians so cold so lukewarm <lau>*, they do not speak for their Lord, they burry the talent or the graces they have had from him, and gradually fall asleep. May God give you grace as well as to David and Paul to confess your Lord, to tell a word in season, thereby God gives often two blessings to him that speakes and to those who hear, 
Now my dearest Frederic adieu
 yours JG

I hope that, tante Anna is better, and that the feever was only on account of the milk my love to all.
