Dear Frederic

Give please this note to Mrs. Isenberg, she will tell you whether I can loge with her when I come, she will perhaps also invite Paul, as tante Anna has had people enough all this time; you may hear all. I shall be the saturday with the Isenberg the sunday in Olga St the monday in Hoch St. I think you will be glad to see Paul still once before he goes back to Maulbron and I shall be glad to see you once more before the Winter. Several things from Unkel Theodore have bin left here we send them per paquet to Stutg I trust you have a good sunday
 Yours J.G.
