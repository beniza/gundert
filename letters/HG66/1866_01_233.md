Dear Frederic

At last a letter from you how long you have left us without a single line though you were at home. So you were obliged to keep in your room fourtnight longer than you expected; for it is just two weeks that Jettle came and said you would next day be able to go out. I trust the Lord has blessed you and inabled you to see more of yown heart that can humble us to see what we are. I also wanted to be tried in order to see how quickly, we become cold towards the Lord and his children, how selfrightious in almost every thing. The patience and long suffring of the Lord is very great toward us. how he waits and uses every opportunity to make us understand. 
I am thank God somewhat better I can hear from the left ear. 
Adieu dear Son
 Yours J. Gundert
