My dear Children

Although I have nothing peculiar to say I will send you my love by these few lines. We have had a good deal of visitors, have still and expect others, so that some times it is amost more than one wishes; but the winter comes soon and we shall be more alone. We have much rain. the harvest has been partly injured by lying too long on the ground, the potatoes are likely to be bad being too wet. the bread costs 19 creuzer instead of 13. The poor people are to be pitied; for many have had no work on account of the war. A man came here from America with the smallpox he died of it, several people took it from him, and it is going on since 3 months that always some are taken ill; not many however.

This summer papa is less well than usual; he does not sleep well, and has some fever;

The three younger sons are well.

I trust that you are well too with wife and the daughters. Is Christina's hand better? Mr DÃ¼rr who was yesterday with us told me how happy he is in America, for nothing in the world would he live in Germany, everything is too narow for him here. in America with 350 Dollars one can live as a rich man a whole family. Now adieu with love and kisses
 yours J.G.
