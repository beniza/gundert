 Calw 2d Dece 1866
My dear Frederic

Although I have nothing peculiar to tell you, I will not let this sunday evening pass without telling you good eve. trusting you have had a good day, by reading and hearing Gods word. had you been in Calw you would have heard you papa who had as I hear grace to speak faithfully as to awake those who sleep or Slumber, I did not go to Church, it is too cold, specially as my teeth are not yet quite well.

Can tante Anna nurse the baby? has she pain on both side, please give my love to her and Caroline and say we think much of her and wish to hear how it goes with Anna and the baby. I long to see you all hear, mean while; we fight and with Gods grace overcome every day somewhat of the old man. No? 
Adieu dear Son
 yours JG.

3d Many thanks for your letter which has already unsewred my questions here; but we iron and I can not write another note I am very sorry to hear of tante Anna having fever,
