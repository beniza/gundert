 <23 April 66>*
Dear Frederic

Only a few words with this opportunity of your wash which I would not send were it not that David's clothes are just finished.

How are you dear son? I hope that you have had a good sunday today! and got blessings by reading the bibel! We have to learn to feed on that holy word which is the bread of life, of course to do this one must have hunger and thurst after it, the misery is that we often are so idle so languide that we make no effort to get something out of God. is it not so? It is a good thing that he the Lord does not change, he is the same in his unspeakable love to us ward. Oh could we but know and believe His great love. 
Gotholt Steiger is here as teacher in the next room with his father, it is a good thing for his health to get the nursing mother, He sais that he is better than he was, I trust also that the communion with the brethren will help him on About Julius I know nothing, niether about Heinrich. Give please my love to all our dear people. Adieu dearest Fredric  Yours J.G.
