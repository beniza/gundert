Should I send imidiatly the box in which you sent me grapes from Mrs. Schwarz? It was very kind of her to think of papa for whom I really wanted some.

Have you perhaps a knitted Juppe which you had once; but which I had afterward given to Paul as he felt the cold too much last winter, He says that he has no more got it and I have not got it here, it is white with long sleaves, be so kind and tell me in your next whether you have perhaps got it.

I was very glad to see by your letter that the business is going on well, let us also going on well, that is, so pray and speak that souls be gained to our Lord, not put our talent in a cloth; but use it for the conversion of others. May God give you joy and peace so that you praise continually His holy name.

Love to all the dear peopel specially to dear Tante Anna and Caroline  Yours JG
