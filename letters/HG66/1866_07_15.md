My dear children

Many thanks for your last in which came the fotographe of Julia she seamed to be quiet; but some what cunning in her fine eyes, I trust we shall see her one day. though my thoughts are continually as if we had but little time till the Lord comes, and when I speak of seing each other I do not think it will be in this world, that is, not as it is yet! I hope the little one with her Mama are well. Today the bride of Sa. is with us, the more I see her the more I like her and I trust they will be happy together aiming at one thing that is bring souls to the knowlege of the Lord. 
Frederic finds the time rather long with us, and according to the state of things he may have to remain much longer; Paul and David continue to give us joy. the Lord is very gracious to them. now and then somewhat excited about the war, In Stutgart one speaks so much of it that Tante is somewhat mouved; for her young borders have a piculiar pleasure to tell her all sorts of tales just to frighten her. The state of commerce reminds one of that word in revelation 18.15.

Now I must say Adieu begging to excuse the shortness of the note With love and kisses to you all and still once, thanks for J. fotog
 Yours J.G.
