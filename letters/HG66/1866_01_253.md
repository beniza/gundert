Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your kind letter. I am glad that you can be again at your work, we shall get more news from you in future. If your wash hat not yet left when you recieve this and there would be room in the box you might send your sheets which you do not want any more, ore any thing old which you do not put on any more.

Your westcoat costs nothing for you.

As you ask what you might give papa on his birthday, I advise you to give a cravat a black one just as you have sent me one last year.

A propos you might send me by papa at his return from Felbach one pound of fine soap Ask Mama or tante where one buys it, by a Mr. Bonds or so Ettle does not remember where; but it is good and much cheaper than here. you know what I mean Seife sich zu waschen; but if it gives you trouble leave it I can get it another time.

So I had not well understood about Mr Weiss, he will be most well come when ever he comes. I thought you come along; but it is true you were here not long aga, and afterward kept your bed, now you will soon see papa which will be a great joy love to all the dear people
 Yours JG.
