 <9 Jan 66>*
Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your letter just recieved. I am glad to hear that your foot is better, the few days you were in bed will have done good to body and soul. no? I rejoice to hear what you say about Paul that you were pressed to pray for him. and even now we must continue; for it may be more difficult for him there having no one to help him nor even to understand him, and the devil will try his best on the escaped former prey of his, and the more so that the work of the Lord is so decided. the devil is like a roaring, furious Lion that one of his should have turned against him. God will help him I know; but he will have to fight hard, and God will make something peculiar out of him for his work.

I am still deaf; but I trust it will soon be better, as I can now perspire and, and perhaps God has told me or taught me the lesson I had to undergo. it was a hard thing for me to tell thy will be done with full heart. repeating day af[ter] day, deaf or hearing I must be pleased. We have to do with a wonderful God. He appears some time terrible, and still He is love 
Adieu dear Frederic. tell David to send soon his boots
 Y. J.G.
