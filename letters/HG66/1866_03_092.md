My dear Frederic

9 Yesterday I was in Nagold Mr Widman with whom I went asked much after your health. Mrs. Zeller too, she had a great joy to hear that our three younger sons are the Lords. Oh dear Frederic jes that is great and wonderful to be the Lords while John tells us in his epistle the whole world lies in the wicked one; that we who are not better than others should have the great priviledge to be children of God, yea heirs with Christ one plante with him, the promise to be one day like him, and to inherit all things; such promises are worth we should fight so as to overcome and recieve the fulfilment of his promises. if you are cast down and discouraged try to think about that which we shall be one day, how the Lord has himself been tempted, had fears and anguish and said several times my soul is troubled unto death, because he has known what is fears he has said so often in the Gospel fear not be of good chear. 10 Today papa had a mission Stunde in die Kirche, very few people but a beautiful text and speach, which you may read afterward in the Missionsblatt, about Harms. text John 7 38 MÃ¶gest du durst haben und so lebendig Wasser viel trinken der gibt es umsonst.
