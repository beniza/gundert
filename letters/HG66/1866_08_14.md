My dear Frederic

Many thanks for your last letter, I am very glad that you have much to do, and the Lord gives you joy I trust and health.

Wed have white washing the whole oehrn or coridore till the Sale, the cookroom and speisekammer, it is a great work because the chunam, plaster is broken in many places; when you come to Calw you will find our walls beautiful. it is a pity they were not made before we had our visitors! may it be so with our souls; that is finer cleaner then they appear to others. Many people are asking after you who saw you during your stay here I hear that Grandmama is not well what is the matter with her? Do you visit her some time?

To day we rejoice to see the sun which we have not seen during several days, we had a great deal of rain, the grains lie black on the grown poor peopel are much disappointed, but God must have a good reason, Adieu dear Son. My love to all.
 yours J.G.

Ask Grossmutter how she is and tell it us!
