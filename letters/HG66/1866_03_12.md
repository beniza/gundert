My dear Frederic

Today we expected to have letters from you both; but nothing has come; perhaps you had no time. When papa got up this morning early, his first words were today we get letters from Stutgart! and behold no letter, One from Paul which gives us joy the Lord is very gracious to him: and He is to you too no?

Apropos on Saturday you are to send me again your wash you and David in One box. we wash so soon on account of Pauls things. As you have few things this time forget not to send the plumon or deke zieher you know what I mean a colored big piece.

13 Many thanks for your wellcome letter. So the Lord is also gracious to you and helps you through, you are right we believe man more than Gott, it is a shame; but it is so, in this we see the patience and longsuffering of the Lord. let us pray for a living real faith!

Today I heard that Gotthold Steiger is ill he has the same illness which you had and still continues teaching; but he suffers rather much, his father will try to get him home for a few weeks, only it is difficult because of want of teachers. Please tell dear Mr Albert Weiss, that I am quite ger√ºhrt at his sending me so much prunes, and I thank him heartily. How much did you pay for your wash? I had paid here, I thought papa had paid my debt long ago.
