My dear Frederic

Tomorrow is Market. Many people may perhaps come to us and we intend to make our goodle. so I shall not have time to write to you. Your box I send by Fetzer he does better then Beiser. You will not forget when you come at Christmas to bring one of your boxes with yours and Davids wash as also Meerredig and a pound of Chocolat from Mr Weiss fabrique. I tell it you now, that you may buy redig and Chocolat in time. I shall still remind you of it next week; but rather buy these things in time than to be in a hurry afterward. My love to all the dear peopel
 yours J.G
