 Calw 6th - 15 Nov 1866
Dearest Marie

I have been reading your letters over and over, You must not trouble yourself to write me so much when you are not well, of course all what you tell me interests me deeply, specially of your feelings, of your faith, and state of mind; and though I am sorry of all your troubles I can but feel how gracious the Lord is to you; through these trials you grow in knowlege of self and and in faith and it is of a great value for you and for the work, these graces are not to be had with much gold, as also not acquired through hearing others talking of them, and the sooner we get them the better by what ever mittle it may be. You say in your letter you will never get strong and fresh like before, you have only to believe the words in Es 40.31 "Die auf den Herrn harren kriegen neu kraft, das sie auffahren mit flügeln, wi Adler, das sie laufen und nicht matt werden, das sie wandeln und nicht müde werden," Our God who said these words is the same who said, "all is possible to him that believeth, the promises have always the same power for He who made them is the same, yet what hinders the fulfilment of the promises? nothing but unbelief; only we have to learn what is that auf den Herrn harren, first we pray, we expect to get that which we have asked, in expecting, often very faintly then we are forced to cry again we then begin to wait all days in crying, and hoping through which we at last learn to harren and beharren, then God cannot delai longer He must do it; because during the time of the trial he has taught us to fear him as it is said. "Ich will ihnen meine furcht ins Herz pflanzen das sie nicht von mir weichen Jer 32.40. then He creates gradually hopes, and confidence, which, throug many shakings gets at last bold like the wedow before the Juge, all these parables and exortations to prayers would get no attention from us if we were not forced to it.

Anna Gundert on the 4th got a son very light and soon over; with her Lord has an other school, than with you, but this is only for you send not this about; Johanna G. percieved many little things between Adolph and Ann which grieve her for instances, scarsly money to live, giving her at once only a few fl on which she must give account till one creuzer, talking of sparing, of working much etc. Johana told her I will speak with Adolph, she quietly said no, I have the Lord to whom I tell every thing He cares for me, she has the secret to be happy that is have much to do with the Lord and little with men; we learn then to be pleased with Gods ways and can do wonders with him. Yes dearest Marie have good courage live with Him and He will also do wonders for you, first, for you, yours and for the souls commited to your charge, for his work in your hand

10th all these days we have been looking anxiously for a letter; but in vain, we trust however, that the cause of the delai arises not from ilness, we must quiet ourselves in looking to God with prayer and wait for an other mail. In Stamheim where papa preached <12> yesterday one talked much of you and send you love, I think, that both the minister and his wife are coming nearer, I like them more than formerly. George specially seams to have got some blessing through our Paul.

Frederic Paul and David continue by God grace to give us joy, they grow in knowlege and in grace, all of them feel that it is necessary to be witnesses of the grace of God, and I am sure it is the means by which we are kept alive, we are then forced to watch and pray much more then if we keep silence, pray to have words of life, pray for a blessing on them, through these means we grow in love towards others. I feel I am very backward in this work and this night God has shown me that I fear men more than God, I am still ashamed before certain people to speak of the Lord. Mrs Armbruster in hospital is ill her Bertha came to nurse her, they send you love you may imagine how often in a day, we are with you, and would like to see and hear, all that which is said about Theodor, I hope the Lord keeps him in health and spares you anxieties,

Adieu my dear children
 yours J.G.
