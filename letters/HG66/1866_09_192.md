 19th Sept <66>*
Dear Friederich

Many thanks for your lasts. I was glad to see how faithful is our good Lord to you ward, we find that with Gods grace we can overcome all, yea the devil and our wicked nature.

Do you see David often is he quite well? no cough any more. Here the mornings are very cold, one can already put winter clothes; To day Frederic Muller is in Zafelstein, He is a nice young man. Helene makes long walks with her papa and Paul. Are you in want of your wash, if not we will wait till after four weeks to send your box.

 Adieu my very dear F
 yours J.G.
