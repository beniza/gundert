My dear Herman,

Only a few lines from me this time, to thank you and your dear wife for the few lines I recieved by the last mail. Herman Gross of whom you have already heard brings you two knitted Kittele for the expected baby. I would have liked very much to send you something else; but papa feared that the things would perhaps not reach you, as the young man is not quite sure, also not accustomed to travel. I trust the Lord will help graciously Christina for the time she expects. We are all well and see with pleasure the vacances coming, to have the children with us, although Frederic and David will have only one day for us, With love to you both kisses to Julia  Yours J.G.
