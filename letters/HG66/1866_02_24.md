Dear Frederic

It is already pretty long since we heard from you. Your letter to Mr. Wirtz was given him; they came here the very evening I had return from Stutgart, papa had read your letter and said O one can give it is all right, You are not displeased at it?

To day I paid a visit to Mrs. Wagner who is not well; and she is anxious about one eye from whih she sees but little, Anna is also kept at home on account of a Catarrh, I saw also Miss Minely Wagner who is very poorly, since the death of her mother she had pain on the right side and sholder; and now she has a Karbunkel in the hand which causes her terrible pains, she cannot sleep at all, she looks very ill. she was glad to see me, asked me to come again, I found there Mrs. Wirz who was very friendly and beged hard I would come again. Mr Wirz has a boil on the cheak is bound as if he had toothach.

What are you doing dear people? is the bridegroon still always with his bride? to day as I write this Mr Hebich is with, give him also my love! papa is in the Verrein. It is soon time to send letters to Marie and Samele do you contribute any thing for it? but you have little time and difficult so long as it is cold.

Love to all Adieu very dear Fredde
 yours J.G
