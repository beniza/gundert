 Calw 25th March 66
Dear Frederic

Although it is scarsly worth while to write more since you come soon, however one word to tell you that you shall be very well come in Calw, Mrs. Steiger was here latele; the news about her son are not worse. Mr Steiger will try to see him there, the mother suposes that he has very bad cost, very seldom meat perhaps once in a fourtnight, milk, spetzele and such thing are the usual food; poor young man who has to speak several hours every day would require meat every day. he did not tell this to his parents the mother heard it from somebody els.

If you have time to visit Mrs Johanes Muller before you come to us, give her please my hearty love, and to all the dear people in your house. I long to see Anna here, are they all well. (Have you given that mony 48 C. to Mama? Have you thanked Ch.W. from me?

Be not displeased that I ask again, but I like to know. It is written owe nothing to no one except love. The letters from Indian will do you good I hope, but that which does us good is faith and prayer this forget not  yours JG
