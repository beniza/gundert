My dear children,

Your last letter describing your journey to Chicago has rejoiced us. your love for your home and family is I dare say well rewarded by your dear partener and children. I hope we shall once see those dear ones who make your joy. I long to hear how is Christina's health and whether her hand is better; It is right dear Hermann not to have a good opinion of yourself nor of your preaching nor of your works, in this manner we learn to lean more on the Lord and consent gradually to let us be guided and led by the Lord. Yea it must even go farther than to have no good opinion of self We have to condemn and hate all that which is done Without the Lord, and a minister specially. I have no doubt that soon, you will know and experience, what a tremendous difference there is, between one who has realised for himself the truth of that which he preaches about conversion, peace, forgiveness of sins, and so on with one who has but knowlege of these in the head. Yea dear Herman it will it must come to something real et efficacious, a living faith makes us new creatures and all our endeavours of mending ourselves help nothing a living faith is that which enables us to get something from God and to please Him. Pardon that I say so much on this subject, I send a tender kiss to your dear to your two pets and self

 Adieu
 Yours affection
 J.G
