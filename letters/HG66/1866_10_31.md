My dear Frederic

Only a few lines to ask you if you could perhaps send me by papa a few Meerredig, if you cannot that is if it gives too much trouble leave them till next opportunity; but if you can I shall be glad, he can take some in his bag. You will have very little of papa dear children, as he will already return on the same day; but in 9 weeks we shall DV. have one day together here perhaps two days. Do you live far away from Uhlandstrase where the poor Christian Steiger is? if not try to see him Gotthold was with him on Sunday, one had hope that he would soon return home; but the inflamation in one eye has returned so that now he must remain longer there, his poor mother is much distressed about him, all the people in the Uhlandstreet know where lives the Doctor Berlin where Christian is.

Adieu dear Son love to all in your house
 yours J.G.

Please give this note to Mrs Isenberg as soon as you can
