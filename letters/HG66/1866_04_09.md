My very dear Frederic

As I wanted the account from the Wirzes for papas s trawser one told me that they were paid you have done it I suppose, is it not? why you should have told me about it. and not spend so your money. Did you give my letter which I gave you to Mrs Isenberg to Jettle? Sunday I have been obliged to remain at home being not quite well, I regretted much not to be able to go to Hirsau with our dear people and injoy the meeting there. Mrs. Wirz thought you were displeased with theme, she found you were cold and dry toward them. I did not know what to say! He had made per du with you in Christmas and now you speak again per sie they are grieved at it. I am glad that you have still two yeards of the cloth I want. be so good and pai it for me, I do not want it now, you can keep it till you send your wash, or till we go to Stutgart.
