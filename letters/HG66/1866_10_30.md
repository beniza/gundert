My dear Children.

Christine has been in Detroit; but you have said nothing of the results. I would like to hear what the Dr has said about her hand!

I trust dear Christina will do better than I have done, that is I also thought every child which we got beginning by Herman, Now with this child I will learn the language Malayalim; but I soon found that Herman spoke it better than me. of Samuel I thought yet this time I mut try that the child does not run before me, but I remaind behind and so with all of them. I never took the time, nor the trouble to learn it well. But one thing we must learn with every new child or without that is, to learn to know the Lord so that He can tell us I know thee by thy Name thou art mein and that we can also say I know thee, thy voice I hear and follow. We must be perfectly sure that at the last day we shall not have to hear from the Lord "I know thee not. Our acceptance by Him mut be always surer; we must be so iniciated in his language that after having first feared, trembled, we get such confidence just as children have toward their parents.

The Lord be praised for the health He gives to your little ones; may you have grace to bring them up for the Lord alone Adieu dear Children love and kisses to you all
 Yours J.G
