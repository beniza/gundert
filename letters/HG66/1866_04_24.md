Dear Children.

Thanks dear Herman for your note of 20th March. I trust by this time dear Christine has got over safely and that the Lord has given you a second child! Dear Herrman you say in your note you know that a mightier force is needed to reach in reality the state of mind we wish you, and you experience it some time; but it is not sufficient, the first principle must be laid. You have not yet pronounced condemnation upon yourself and your doings, the description of the 7th of Rom which is the first step to new life you have not yet gone through, at least you never told us any thing of it; before we be dead and burried with Christ we cannot rise, that is before we feel and confess our utter corruption, our impossibility to do any thing to please God, and so dispise our self and saying Oh wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this death, till we in truth so condemn ourselves, we are the old creatures, and all what we do to better ourselves is like new pieces put to an old garment. I must dispair of self. reject abhor my selfrightiousness and accept the one of my Saviour alone to mix them together and have both, will never do. Oh dearest Herman I trust the Lord will give you this great and unspeakable grace, to experience what is that to pass from death to life, from darkness to light, Be not offended with me for telling you things so plainly. I love you both and remain  Y J.G.
