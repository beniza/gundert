My dear Frederic

I am going to send you your box very soon, in it you will send a few things for David. also I trust a piece of heidebeer Cake which you shall part for your three gentlemen and David. I intend D.V. to have wash the week papa is to go to Stutgart for the Mission feast. I will still write you afterward about it. How is Nast? have you some work? is there prospect that it will soon be better? I am very glad that your dog has been found, it is a good sighn for unkel! Do you hear any thing of Charles Weigle, is he to come to Stutgart?

I hope you are happy in the Lord and well in your body!

With love to you all
 Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
