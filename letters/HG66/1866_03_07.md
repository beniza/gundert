 <7 Marz 66.>*
My dear Frederic

7th evening today I have been more with you than usual, I trust you have had a good day felt that men and specially God love you dearly. It is somthing precious to be able to believe that one is loved. this alone takes away fears and doubts. We are touched at the idia of some body loving us; but what is the love of creatures they change, but our Lord who has once redeemed us loves us always with an Eternal love. Why have we so difficult to believe his love? We would have so much more easier if we were quite sure of his great and constant love. We would care much less for creatures. 8th Your letter has just come for which many thanks. I thank the Lord that you experienced so much love. tell us also what token of love you have recieved from other people, and who are the friends who showed you kindness? We like to know every thing. To morrow I go to Nagold with Mr. Widman, we return the same evening. My love to the dear people in your house; has tante Anna told you nothing for me? from whom are the Zwetschen; the Gichtpapier has not come. Yes dear Son live so with the Lord that you hear his voice and be led by him alone by his precious word. Adieu
 yours J.G.

Have you still got the key of your old wash KÃ¼stien or have you given it to David? If you have it send it to David that he may open it I have sent him the old box and one of you must have the key
