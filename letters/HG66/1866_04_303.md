 <30 April 1866.>*
Dear Frederic

I have visited Mr Wirz and invited him for Mission, feast of which he was very glad. He told me of having seen you and your having renued the per du that s right. As I am not sure wether you come or any one from Suttgart I will not let your box go without a few lines. If it continue to rain as today we shall have left people than it would have been otherwise, How is tante Anne why does not Unkel Adolph comes? and Albert? We have quite room enough.

Now Adieu
 Yours J.G.
