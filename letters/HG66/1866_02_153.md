 Calw 15th Febr. 1866
Dear Frederic.

The lady who sat in the postcarriage with me, was the Pfarer's fraue from Ostelsheim rather a nice lady. It was very cold, the road frosen all the way till we came to Calw where I found papa who had just made his walk, his shoes and trawsers full of mud, I was glad to get a good warm dinnar, Apropos I forgot to ask you this morning how you were, is your stomack quite well? Did you sleep well? The old man Kaufman father of the young man who shot his fingers here has died he was burried on tuesday, poor man, would have been so glad to live still. Your commissions to the Wirzes I shall D.V. make tomorrow. You do not forget mine to Mama?


In your next tell me how is tante and give her hearty love from me I am glad I have seen you all there give my love to tante Caroline too. 
I trust you are happy in the Lord Goodbey dear Son
 yours J. Gundert
