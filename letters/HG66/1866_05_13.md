 13th <Mai 66>*
My dear Frederic

Many thanks for your kind letter. You are right God has given us such a nature or such nerves by which we can learn to know ourselves, condemn at last all that which comes from self, and so pray and wait for his grace and help to overcome this wicked self.

I rejoice that you feel happy; you have good reason to be chearful, you are beloved of God and of men, is it not, Ah! could we but believe his great and unspeakable love we could than also love in return. But we will daily more more praise and thank our Lord it is also a sort of love. yes when our wicked heart does not think it worth to praise we have to force us as it were and repeat "my soul praise the Lord, and forget not His goodness. So must we speak to our Soul when she is idle and slow.

Hannesle from St is not better. Heinrich G. is in Tubingen to consult there a professor <Bruns>* and hear whether he is to go to Wildbad. It is nice of you to inquire often after Mr Moerike.

Had you been in Hirsau to day you would have said it is just that which I want it was really fit for people like we are, it was about the 6 of John, hunger and thirst is what is wanted to be happy. we learn then to eat the Word or Christ's flesh and drink his blood, this alone gives us life. Have you also hunger? I wish you plenty of it. With love to all
 yours J G.
