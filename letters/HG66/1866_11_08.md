My dear Frederic

It was indeed a long time since you wrote; but we thought that you had likely much to do; Your few lines have done me good, to hear the Lord is gracious that you have peace, is all what I wish to hear, if you have not time for more.

Do you see the baby often, does he cry much? I suppose Gross Mama comes daily. Are the Unkels Albert and Charles much pleased of a little one? Our Paul who is so fond of babies would have great joy; when he was here, he used to take away the stockings of that little child of the Americaner to admire its feet.

I hope that tante is quite well and can nurse her little one. 
We are waiting anxiously to hear from Marie! but perhaps we shall have to wait still a fourtnight.

Mrs. Steiger has gone to day to Stutg to take her poor Christian home. Adieu my dear Frederic still 7 weeks and please God we shall see you all  Yours J.G.
