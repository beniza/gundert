My dear Frederic

very likely you will have gone with your papa to the Mission feast I am glad for you if so. When you were here we have scarsly seen each other, but soon we shall have a while together I trust, at Gustaves marriage. 
Marie s letter will give you joy. the others I have sent to papa, who will I dare say send them soon to you, and your own I have taken the liberty to send to Paul who has less good things than you is it not? He will of course return it soon to you,

Write me also during papa's absence it does me good to hear from my kindern. Are you happy in the Lord?

I am to go to Stamheim with Elisabeth Isenberg. Hanesle is very ill I wish to see him, and it is good for Elisabeth to go out Love to all our dear peopel.

Where did papa sleep in Hochstrase or Olka
