 Calw first March 66
My dear Frederic

The days are already becoming so long that there is but little time more for me to write as I used to do from 5 to 7 O'c. How are you, still pain in your stomach? but none in the heart I trust. I mean you are happy and quiet in God who has done wonderfully for you. We have wash so rather little time, I know that you are not offended if you get but a few words from your Mama, you know she loves you truly and wishes you grace and peace. 
Search in God's word you shall find food, ja rich food for your soul if you are hungry.

With a kiss yours
 J.G.

Give the enclosed to Tante when she be alone
