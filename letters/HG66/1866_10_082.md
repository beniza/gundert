My dear Frederic

Since I saw you last I am often with you in my mind. I trust that you have a good time in the Lord. and expirience that through faith we can overcome all, for we walk from faith to faith and get the victory. May you have much joy and peace,

Paul must soon leave us we have had a good time together Paul Mohl is also happy in our midst. Christmas is soon coming in which we shall D.V. see again each other, the three dear sons with us, till then we pray for each other and love each other more and more,

Adieu dear F
 Yours JG.
