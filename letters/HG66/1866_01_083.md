Dear Frederic

I was sorry to hear from papa that you were not well. it will have made you sad to be obliged to remain at home instead of going to Kornthal. but God will also have taught you a lesson for which you will praise him, we want always now and then a knock from the Lord, either to awaken us or to humble us. We have it so difficult to abide in the Lord although we know well that without him we can do nothing. Oh how much patience the Lord must have with us so long we are still some thing to our own eyes and imagination I trust conversion of Paul has been a great joy to you and hope the Lord will use it even to do good to his brothers and sister, who have not been brought so suddenly to the Lord, and have also had less communion with him, as well as less temptations and grief at having little or no peace and joy with the Lord. The way he reads yet the word of God is a sure sign of growing, going forward. Ah dear Frederic be of good cheer the work of the Lord is also began in you; it must grow yea feed also more on the word of life and you schall be quickened and belebt. We have the same good Lord who workes the will and the doing. We must look upon him and be faithful I trust your foot is better with love
 yours JG
