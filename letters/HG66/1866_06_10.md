 Calw 10th June 1866
My dear Frederic

I hope you have a good day and feed on the word of life. to day I have read the last chp of the Eph, I thought of you in reading it. in it we see what kind of wepons or armour we are to put on in order to fight and stand, firm, the last 18th ver has specially drawn my attention. we understand as yet but little how to pray. "praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints. Tell dear Frederic are we not very far from knowing this continual prayer? I trust you continue to pray with David; when the devil comes with all sorts of reasons and hinderances, you withstand him and believe firmly the promise the Lord has made in Matthew 18.19 if you should not see immediatly a answer or a blessing nevermind pray only, the Lord must be true to his promise and sooner or later answer your prayers, He alone can make you firm unmovable, keep you so that your are neither high nor low or cast down, He is a Rock and on Him we must rest Adieu dear F
 yours JG
