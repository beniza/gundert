Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your last. I was glad to hear that your foot is better. The Lord has not left you without some blessings during these days? In bed one is brought to pray more, to search oneself and if the Lord opens our eyes how many reasons do we not find to humble ourselves, how poor and miserable. how do we cheat ourselves and forget what we are, and how all is pure grace from the Lord if we have any life any love, does it not strike you that this feeling is deep in Paul. I should have learned from him; but the Lord who had intended blessings and humiliations for me has brought them in a way I thought little of. however to him be glory and praise. All that which can humble us, and put us really down before the Lord is to be wellcome, and much work fruits of rightiousness to Gods glory.

I am pretty much the same with hearing; I leave it to the Lord. If only I understand well what he has to teach me through this.

Love to all
 Yours JG
