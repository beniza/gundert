Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your having written so quickly. I am verry sorry that you have still so stomachache you must beg Tante to let you have a Krug or bettflashe in your bed; and you should bind your stomach with a flanell I shall send you one when I send Davids Ã¼berzieher on monday. till that you might take your old flanell banian or your schawl.

 Let us know soon how you are with love to all
 yours J.G.
