My dear Frederic

I am still often in thoughts in Stutgart amongst you. Give my hearty love to Aunt Anna and Caroline. I had a real joy with you all. tell me in your next if Uncle Adolph is well.

I have been the whole day with Mrs. WÃ¶hrle because her Christine is very ill. however to day one has more hope of her life than yesterday. Poor papa has had a great deal to do today, preached and had kinderlehr in Nevhenstat after which Stundy in Hirsau and now he is in Junglingsverrein. 
To day I hear much less than yesterday or when I was at Stutgart it is perhaps from the wind which was very strong when I went to Zafelstein; I trust it will come again as when I was in Stutgart. Try to keep your self worm at night that you may not have pains in your stomach, put some thing heavy on the foot of the bed, that the wind does not go between, I hope you are happy in the Lord and feel his great love toward you. Next suterday you will have to send us your wash.

Adieu dear Son, Love to all
 Yours J.G.
