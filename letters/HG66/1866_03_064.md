 <Calw 6 Maerz 66.>*
My dear Frederic

So tomorrow is your birthday. What can I wish you more than I do daily, that is that the Lord who has redeamed you, might so renew his image in you that you may be able to say once with Paul I live not I but Christ lives in me. Je dear Son Christ with in us, Glorifiing the father who has drown us to the Son in whom we have Eternal life

May God give joy and peace by the Spirit. that your all joy and delight may be in him.

I wish I could send you some thing valuable which you would like. but I do not know what

Accept love from yours
 J. Gundert

love to all our dear people
