 <22 Februar 1866.>*
Dear Frederic

This time you get only a few lines from me; but you have so much from Marie that it will suffice you. How are you dear Son? No more pain? 
You do not forget I pray you the knife which mama was to buy for me, put it in your box with the wash which you send me next Saturday, 24th 
You should keep two sheets in Stutgart, you know I had told you to send them to me with the plumon cover; but leave rather two sheets there when I come once I will use them for some purpose. How are your dear people I have nearly heimweh after you all.

I shall be glad to see tante Anna by us for a few weeks. I paid a visit to Mrs. Ansel told her of the happy bride her cousine Miss Pfeifer, they were all glad to hear of it. Also glad to hear that we have the prospect to see them here in Caravan.

Now I have gschwazt genug. ich will auch Adieu sagen und w√ºnsch dich friede und freude
 deine J.G.
