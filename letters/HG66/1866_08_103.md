Dear Frederic

You may send the corcks with your wash; but it will make rather a large paquet you might perhaps put that paquet on your box, as you will have David's wash with yours, you shall send it on the 20 monday please with the Omnibus, if the omnibus should not go, you would send per Beiser Saturday I will inquire, I am glad to hear that with yourself and work it goes well. may God keep and bless you, feed your soul with the word of life, then, it will go well with you; As long as it is worm you put on your summer cloth no? when they are dirty you can send them to us per paquet through David I shall have them washed

Now dear Son Adieu love to all your peopel
 yours J.G.



1Dear Frederic and David

Only a few words of love today, you have your papa it is enough. I trust your trawsers will be right dear David, one could not make them better; they will do for this summer. I shall perhaps come to Stutgart when papa goes to Bitigheim, it is still to be seen whether papa goes to Bale from Stutgart or from Calw.

love to you both
 yours J.G.

I shall have nothing to put in your box when your wash comes, so take now these bits of cake as if they had come with your wash.

Adieu dear Sons. papa will pay you the corcks
