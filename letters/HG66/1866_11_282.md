 Calw 28th Nov /66
My dear Frederic

Many thanks for your kind letter, the Lord be praised that he gave you the victory over yourself, so that you could forgive, if there were no opportunities for us to forgive others, we would not know how bad we are, nor understand why the Lord said "pray for you ennemies" I would not have known it if we had not come in this house.

I trust it will soon be over with Tante Anna can she nurse her big son? it will be very difficult with a sore breast it is very painful at least. 
Still four weeks not even and DV we shall be together tell me please how is David? you did not answer my question about Christmas. Had Mrs Isenberg no letter from Elisabeth? At Christmas you shall bring or send your box with yours and Davids wash and specially the Meerredig.

Adieu my dear son
 Yours J.G.

Emilia Seger sends love and Louise
