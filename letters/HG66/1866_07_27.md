 <Calw 27 Juli 1866.>*

Good morning dear Frederic

So you found Mr Nasch ill. poor young man I hope Mrs. Bonet takes care of him, take also the opportunity to speak to him of his soul.

And how are you going on you still find I trust that in the Lord we get the strength which we want to overcome, every day we have some thing to overcome, and now you will have more occasion to this daily exercise, since Nasch is ill, he cannot do his work, so that you may have to do things which you do not like; but take good courage; the Lord will help you. look to him with a settled mind to fight and overcome, the victory is surly yours; but die to self you must.

How is the servant girl going on, When you write next speak a little of the house haltung Anna likes to hear.

 Adieu my dear
 yours J.G.
I have also heimweh.
