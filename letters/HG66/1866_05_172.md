Dear Frederic

Papa wrote you to day through Julius; but I did not find time for it then, however he told me that he would not forget to tell you to send me your wash on Monday 21rst Yesterday was sitzsung papa is still very tired from it and from the journey. I am also sleepy and tired. Louise was three days in bed, she is again up though weak. Mrs Werner was here with her husband. I was very glad to see her, she asked much after all the Children, they have a son in Urach who seeks also the Lord; he finds hard and difficulte to have to fight continually Soon dear Frederic shall we see each other I hope. You are well I trust and have grace to overcome flesh and will at least in part, die we must in order to live. How is uncle Adolph much cast down? Here Mr Wirz is much troubeld and down in case the war should come; of course for Merchants and fabricants it would be hard and the ruin of many of them, and the poor laborours in the fabrick! altogether it would be a terrible distress; but the Lord can still spare us all this trouble if it should be right. We are happy to have Him as father he cares for us. Love to all
 yours J.G.
