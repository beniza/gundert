Dear Frederic

One word only to pray you not to forget to send your wash on monday next 20th if you should forget or the Omnibus were not going send it per post not the box; but a paquet; I heard yesterday that the Omnibus goes still, put your wash and David s wash in one box, I hope that you are well and happy, You will soon have your papa with you to make you joyful; but in the Lord we are to be joyful without creatures; Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
love to all
