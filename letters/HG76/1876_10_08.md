My dear Children [Hermann]

Again a good letter from you for which many thanks. I am glad to hear that dear Julie had no wish for the Theater, God keeps her for Himself, happy child, good also that the parents deal wisely with her, may the Lord guide you from moment to moment.

These days we feel a little anxious about the paquet which has been sent to Bremen for you having heard nothing from Mrs. Zeller about its arrival; but Frederic comforts us saying that it would have been returned here if Mrs Z had not taken it, it may be that she had not time to write before imbarquing. well we can but recommand it to God, and hope that it will rich you. 
The death of our dear papa Heerman will surprise you having perhaps not heard of the illness. This morning about 6 O'c he departed quitely after 10 or 12 days of great weakness, no illness; but very nervous, Uranie who is pretty well salutes you heartily, and I with a tender kiss to Mama with her baby and two daughters
 Yours affectionate JG.
