1My dear Children [Hermann]

Your last letter brought us the sad news of dear Tine having fever it made us to sigh to the Lord and feel with you how we are to live with the Lord so that we be prepared every moment to experience that we enter the Kingdom through many tribulations, and if we understand our father we shall praise Him for every one; for our hairs are numbered He cares so tenderly so fatherly will only teach us and prepare us for certain blessings which we are to get; but mean while He has to clean and make room for that which is His, Surely my dear Tine and yourself will say after Paul Affliction on the moment is not joyful but grievous, but afterward it workes the fruits of rightiousness. O could we only hear and understand our dear Lords teaching we would praise for every thing, yea for all that which at first appears to be grievous, All that which help us to know our Lord, His will, should be accepted with a childlike mind. We are with you in thoughts and our sympathy though fatherly equal not the one of our Lord,

May you soon feel that He is love and be restored to health to praise His name, Let no tryal pass without crying for the blessing God intended us to get

Adieu my very dear Children
