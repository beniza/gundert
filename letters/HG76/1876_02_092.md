Herrn D Gundert, per adr Herrn J F Steinkopf in Stuttgart

 1C. 9th Fbr 76

Eben lese ich die Ankündigung des kirchl. Concerts Also bitte ich Dich auf Freitg für BT zu sorgen, if I knew that Gustav was there I should have written to him, but now leave it to you. She would arrive 6.25 be fetched by somebody that goes to the concert, sit at Church till it is over, go then to G. (or whoever it be - but that seems nearest and she likes to see children) pass night and day in seeing you all and physicking nursing curing E. and return with you Saturday evening. No need of farther letters if these arrangemts can be carried out.

 Goodbye HG
