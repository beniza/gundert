My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for several letters which I am not going to ansewr but only thank for.

It gives us much joy and cause of thanksgiving to hear the Lord let you see fruits of your labour, there is no such joy in the world, though this joy may be mixed with some apprehension for the future about the groth of the new plantes, belief and rest in God who works the will and do inable us to rejoice with gratitude. All the news you give us interest us much. Dear Mama with her daughter had the gripp I trust that it is past, We have had two cards from papa on his way to Bremen, he sends you perhaps news from there, The friends from Rolle send you hearty love; Frederic and myself had a nice and pleasant visit there. You know that at last Uranie has made up her mind to remain here. May the Lord greant us seasons of refreshement, it is of course difficult for all of us because of the language one is genâ€š, As Uranie is suceptibel* well. I hope it may be for the profit of each side. We look patiently on the expected news of middle June, May the Lord give joy and thanksgiving for the granted help and gift that new born babes may occur in the congregation and at home

With hearty love and kisses to my dearest Tine and girls
 Yours affectionate JG

love from Uranie
