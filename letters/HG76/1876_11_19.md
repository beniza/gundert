1Dear Children [Hermann]

We were much pleased to hear that the paquet has arrived, I thank God I have recommended it to Him several times, We are also very glad to hear that all of you are pleased, We hope the visit of old papa Huss with you may be a blessing for him Dear Tine I am so very glad to hear how she grows in the knowlege of her Saviour and in faith, she has a good smell of things, having naturally good tact she can discern things in others, as in her sister in law. We thank God that He has spared your dear Julia She will surely have learnd from the Lord somewhat more of His love and tenderness. 
In this year have died four of our neighbours, the old Nashold Kerber, Hairing formerly Waldhorn Hotelkeeper, than two women still young. 
There is goodeal of illness about, many Children with the measel. Uranie has a Catarrh; but not ill, she sends hearty love.

May God give you joy in the congregation by bringing many souls to Him whom you preach,

Much love to my dear Tine Julia Marie Emma and papa with a tender kiss
