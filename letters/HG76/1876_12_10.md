My dear Children [Hermann]

I was very glad that you wrote a note to Youngfer Mine Laure, she values it very much, she was exceedingly pleased, with your note I sent her, her Christkindle as every year because she is our dressmaker; but your note gave her more joy than my present which she however liked, After her returned from Hamburg I thought she was seeking the Lord; but now I fear she is driven away by the world.

My dear Tine with her daughters are I suppose busy for Christmas, Since some years we make no goodle, the children get enough from other peopel, one is exagerated in those things.

Every sunday and thursday papa has for Uranie a Bibelstunde, were it for this only I am glad that Uranie is here I value it more than anything else, today we had the 12 Ch in Hebrews. the second verse I had not understood; what was the joy set before Him, last thursday it was about the first love how we loose it, when the love of Jesus toward us the forgiveness of sin is no more appreciated and felt by us always frish and new than the first love and zeal is decreasing

Adieu with a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours J.
