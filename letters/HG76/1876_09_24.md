My dear Children [Hermann]

By one Carte recieved yesterday <Samstg (23. Sept)>* we see that you were all well, and Anna had a place as teacher we are glad for it. 
We are busy these days preparing a few things for a certain Emma Gundert, Grosmama sends her a blue long dress, two collars for Mama, some lace made by Uranie <not new> perhaps for collars for Julia and Marle, Jettle, Marie, Emma will also have the joy to send something for baby, so that none of your daughters will have had so fine clothes as the 3d one. I am so very glad there is an opportunity once. Uranie wanted to send a good silver watch; but remembering that one took one from Francis who had two on himself they feared and will rather ask Francis to send one.

The winter will soon begin, I hope that my dear Tine shall not suffer in her hands, but have a good winter. that is grow in the knowlege of our Lord and in Child like confidence in faith that alone can make us truly happy. With a tender kiss to each of you and love from Uranie
 Your JG
