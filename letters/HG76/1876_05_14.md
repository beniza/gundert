Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind note you heard all about our journey, and also that we cannot leave here before Wednesday. At Rolle we were recieved with much love, they were all inchanted with Frederic and Mm. Ruynat said no wonder that he caught the perle of Calw, as I had called Emma so as she was a bride, We had a fine dinnar with Mme R who with all of them send you hearty love, more about them all when we meet, I returning from R it was so very cold that both us have a cold Frederic on the right side of the head, one eye red and running with water as well as the nose My self ear ach and pein on the left side of the head. This last night two degres of ice, on the mountains near the snow, earth quak repeatedly. I fancy that it is even colder here than in Calw; perhaps now you have colder too than when we left. Today we made many visits and had some, we shall be glad when all be over, I do not think I shall go to Neuchatel, one has to walk much to find the peopel, Mr Michaud has been buried last week it is a loss for many, Uranie goes alone to the meeting as F and myself are not quite well, We were amused to hear how how Julia plays or jocks at her papa absence, she will be glad to see him again, I am sorry to hear that John had again migraine; but this weather trys many constitution, We are to be with the Dothaux for caffe on Tusday there daughter from Thun is just with them, her eldest daughter is ingaged to a fabricant, a good party as one says, It seems that Uranie has enough of her present girl who is indeed trying to be the Mistriss.

Much love from Uranie and from me to all with you and vis a vis d Hotel de Ville, Steinhause, how to dear Jettle many thanks for her kind letter, 
With love and good wishes
 Yours afftly J. G.
