Herrn Candidat Frohnmeyer, Missionshaus in Basel

 <20 Febr 1876>*

I do not know how I came to suppose that I would reach your place on the other side of the Rhine. I therefore correct my last by adding that about 5.40 on Monday I hope to land by the way from Schaffh Beuggen etc. and that I of course am glad of some assistance for dispatching Miss T's luggage to the other terminus by a safe way. Now farewell for the present from yours affly
