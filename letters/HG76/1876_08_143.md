My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of the 27 July, We were glad to hear that dear Tine with the baby are again well, that the little one vomit is a mark that she has a good stomack rejecting the milk which is too much for her, let her drink less at a time. Mama is a good nurse, she has plenty milk, more than I had. my children had nothing to reject; but had hunger after having drunk; for want of milk or unsatisfied thus cried. Through our children we have much to learn faith and patience begin perhaps with many with their childrens education, how many sighs have mounted before God caused by the illnes and troubles with Children.

Frederic writes us seldom because it pains him to write and therefore we donot ansewer his letters soon that he may not fancy himself to have to write again, According to the papers you have a fearful heat good for dear Tine that she may be out of bed, I can imagine the joy she has with her Emma, and the sisters have no less joy too We would like to have an occasion to send her a bit of clothes,

Uranie vous envoye beaucoup d'amities, papa va grace a Dieu mieux, Avec des baisers … ma chŠre Tine aux trois fillettes et a toi meme cher fils Je reste
