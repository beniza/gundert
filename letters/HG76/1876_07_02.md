My dear Children [Hermann]

We were looking anxiously for the letter, and after having red it we said so patience is wanted. We were glad to see that dear Tine was happy and of good courage, on the 15 or 16th I felt myself drown so very near herself that I thought It might just be the time of her troubel, we wait on the faithfulness of our Lord on His one may reley; but on ours it is dispairing. how very little have I thought hitherto on the meaning of the word faithful, and the Lord looks so much to that, taking it as a great and praiseful thing, How many teachings blessings, graces are misused and unfruitful through unfaithfulness, How great is the patince and longsuffing of the Lord, bistowing grace upon grace light upon light on unwatchful and unfaithful children, really how blind am I still on this one point biside many others but this one is the mean of keeping valuing the graces recieved instead of scandering* them. What a fall*. God be praised that He is not tired of me, or rejecting me. May you be faithful and hear once the Lord telling you Thou hast been faithful in small things thou shalt have greater treasures or kingdome. I hope that my dear Tine has the joy to nurse a new born babe and that all is well

Much love from Uranie and from me with kisses to each of you  Yours affectly J Gundert
