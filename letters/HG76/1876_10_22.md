1My dear Children in America [Hermann]

This week we have no letter from you. We hope however that you are all well and that the delai is from the post. Your last told us of the baby trying already to stand on her feet, and Julia giving up gladely the theater the Lord keeps Himself your children and your selves from all evel, how good it is to be kept and led by Him and live with a child like confidence. 
Dear Tine learns that more and more in nursing and educating her children, what a great thing is that to have faith, live in faith for every thing small and great how precious it is to rest in God, and wait on him, for whatever may come, troubles, sorrows, grives, As joy, everything taken as from our Lord for our education and profit.

I feel that the winter is coming and presses on my nerves in this also He will help He who has been a man and can feel with us.

How are dear Tines hands? May God give her a good winter.

Frederic has some what like Tine on his two fingers; but much less than last year,

Uranie is pretty well works much. Knitt for us all small and great she likes to have your letters translated, she sends you much love, And myself a tender kiss to each of you
