My dear Children [Hermann]

Again a good letter from you, many thanks for it. I have just seen Mrs Zeller <v. Cleveland>*, Auguste <geb. Burk>* who saw you before your baby was born <ja, ich war in Cleveland aber schon Octob 1875 (also vor 1 Jahr)>*, you said than "My wish is to have two girls more still," I regrette that she could stay here but a quarter of an hour she came with her sister MÃ¶ricke <von Basel, Wittwe des Missionars>* I am glad to hear my dear Tine learns more and more the way of faith and Child like confidence in God. the more we know God the more we learn to walk by faith from moment to moment. taking every thing as from His hand I fancy to see her talking with the baby who by this time knows her already, if I could knitt I would have made for her a few jaquets or Kittele; but it will come I hope Mrs Zeller may take some thing from us Uranie sends you hearty love, and myself with kisses to Mama the three children and papa
 yours affectly JG
