 <Calw 31 Aug 76>*
My dear Children in India [Samuel]

It is a long time since I wrote you and heard from you direct, We are always rejoiced of the good news about your sweet baby, May the Lord preserve and bless him with you,

You will have been glad to hear that Bergfelt remains in Germany as you like Mangalore; you will soon see Marie Weigle, she is humbel the Lord may use her I trust in His work, we all like her well.

Uranie sends you love; she and myself are very thankful for the two hours he kindly gives us in french every week, if Uranie had not that blessing she could scarsly remain here; it is always a joy when thursday evening and sunday come to hear papa explaining the Bibel to us both, Since I cannot go to Hirsau as formerly for the meeting I am glad to have some thing at home; for in Church I do not understand.

New preachings of Hebich have been printed; but all the works of man equal not those of Steinhofer After the Bibel he is the first.

I feel that the winter is coming; my hands are getting stiff and paining. The evenings are already very long at 5 one has the lamps, and you are spending your evenings before the hause with your dear baby, to whom I send a kiss as well as to yourselves in love
 yours affectly J. G.
