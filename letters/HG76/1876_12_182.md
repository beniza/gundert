Mon cher Herman et chere Tine

Many thanks for your kind letter I am very glad to hear that the watch has caused such joy, Uranie will not allow me to pay it she will partout do it; We have not yet heard from Fran‡ois about it, besides Uranie sends you 50 Mark as Christkindle, dear Tini will know how to use them. Till now dear Uranie is well thank God and not much heimweh, Do not mention in your letters that which she sends you except to her self.

We would like to see your dear children round the Christmas tree I wish them much joy to papa and mama too, the unspeakable present of God to us of His son should be every day frisher and livelyer in our hearts how pr‚chious and dear should it stand before us; but oft it is not so at least for me.

Dear George Muller from Bristol is a blessing for many people, there is some thing so sober so clear, so Jesus like minded that it does good to hear or read his discourses, about prayer so intent so childlike, in love so fervent, patient, pityful, I think many will say having heard how backward we are, how poor; but also believe that He who has worked in Muller will work that in us, having given us a longing after such grace 
Adieu my dear Children and Grand Children with a tender kiss  yours affectly
 JG

from Uranie much love
