 <Juli 76>*
Dearest Marie

Many thanks for your good kind letter in Frensh I was so very glad for Uranie who sends you thanks and love, she loves the boys very much, finds that they are good boys, I too am quite pleased with Theodor who is alone, and we shall be glad when he comes back. As for news you do not expect from me to get any for I know that Jettle and papa tell you all the perticulars I only wanted to thank you in hope to get more from you.

Adele seems to give you; but very little troubel, I can imagine the joy there will be, Give my love to all in Weisenstein, specially to Jene, I would like to see the dear papa I hope the Lord gives grace to dear John so that many souls may be received and converted, we think of him before the Lord. His jugement on that book of Marie Monnard appears to me more and more to be correct.

Adieu my dear Children, No news of a baby in America as yet

 With a kiss Yours affectly
 JG.
