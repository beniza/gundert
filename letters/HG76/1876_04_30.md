My dear children

Only a few words to tell my dear Christine that she should be of good comfort and not mind all the old women stories. Before Samuel was born in Tellichery as I was sitting at school with all the girls, very busy at my work, at once stood before me a woman not taller than a Child, with such an appearence that I cried loud for fear I was much frighted, the girls who saw my trouble drove away the poor little woman who had entered the room unaware to beg. I thought like you it will hurt the child and dreaded what may possibly happen, Samuel was hapily born inspite of all my fears. The devil likes to make us afraid with one thing or another, the repeated words of our Lord must be seized with faith: "fear not, be quiet," He has pity with us, and knows that the devils joy is to make us afraid, therefore has said often fear not, even when the disciples were in danger, if He is with us nothing is to be feard May He tell you I am with thee fear not 
Adieu my beloved yours
