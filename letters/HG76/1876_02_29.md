My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last long good letter. I do not enter in all the particulars, for I must still spare my arm, that dear Tine will not have a gold watch has rejoiced me, She may do what she likes with with the 100 marks papa will send her once. About David you judge him very mild were you with him for some days or weeks you would find that he is very proud and can make it difficult for others to work with him, having a too good opinion of his own doing and ready to find faults with others works, I feed deeply grieved at his manners and I can but pray that God would give him a broken heart and et contrite spirit.

I see perhaps things with a dark glass; but that is my feeling about him 
With a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours affectly JG.
