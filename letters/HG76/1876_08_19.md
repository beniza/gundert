 1D. d. 19 Aug <76>*
Dear Sir

I have to thank you for the kind letter sent with the pamphlet about Mr PS. Being a reader of the "Record" I was aware of the controversy which had been provoked by the writings and doings of Mr S. But tho' I have to confess that I never saw or heard him, during his visit to Germany, I cannot conceal from you that I look upon his proceedings in our neighbourhood as in the main acceptable and useful to simple unprejudiced minds and really blessed by God consequently I am not able to join in a campaign against him. Not that I consider him as a safe teacher on several points of doctrine, but his relating what he has experienced himself has done good and as he continually stated that he is no theologian, I could only rejoice and thank God that crowds assembled to hear the name of Jesus magnified by a lay man, the mistakes intermingled with his statements appeared to me of secondary consideration

You are of course aware that in our hypercritical country statements and doings have been dissected and discussed abundantly, so much so that many simple people have been half ashamed of the impression he made on them while others of the impressed were by the stern reproofs of the watchmen of Zion driven into the ever open arms of the 3 Methodist communities which profess to continue the work of Mr Smith. In this confused state of matters I do not think it advisable to spread your German pamphlet indiscriminately tho' I shall thank you to send me about half a dozen of copies in order to communicate your views to men able and willing to prove all things and hold fast that which is good.

Lieber nach Deutschland kommen und preach your Gospel!
