1My dear Children

At last good news inspite of some preceding troubles and anxiety, The Lord be praised He has helped and Emma is as dear to me as an Herman would be. 
Our Lord who has the future in his sight and hands does all right so that we have but to thank and believe. I can imagine how happy are Julia and Marle, how they will help Mama to care for the baby. May Mama soon feel strong and well, it seems that she has much milk, however she should not nurse alone too long time it weakens, Papa is to day in Buhlach for a mission feast, since 10 days he is not well there is somewhat wrong with the liver <s. Papa v. 15-17 Juli)>*, he has fever too, I regrette that just now he has several mission feast where he should speak, and you know he does not care for his health being hard to himself.

Jettle with the boys have also gone to Bulach, One feels that the boys have got a father who keeps them in order it is easier now to have them than formerly. From Russia they write in good spirits; may John be faithful and become a blessing for many, the old father seems to be a nice man, All in the hause seem to be very grand and nobel; but I would rather come to your house than in the Barones one, How glad would we be to see your joy surounding your babe with the sisters admiring every movement and look of baby, May God give you joy in seeing new borne souls in the congregation. Uranie joins with me in sending love and kisses to each of you how gladly would we send something for the baby
