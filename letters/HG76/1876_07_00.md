 <Juli 76>*
1My dear Marie

Only a few words; for I am not in spirit for writing having to do with celler and garden. Many people ask after you, Resele Kapler prayed so warmely for dear John in our prayer meeting Monday, both with many other look forward with anticipation for the thursday meeting and we wish all and pray that He may be a blessing for many, however he must remember his health for which the present rest should be used, I have seen several time the Sperschneider the more I see of them the more I like them, they have happily a nice girl after the useless one who went to Pforzheim she was so unclean that one could not enter the cookroom so much it stank
