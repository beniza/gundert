 C 10 Sept 76
My dear David

Today you are with Major Carr I was glad to hear it and I hope that the Lord has given you some blessings among those dear peopel. We had Collonel Halliday with us two days I liked him; but I would be more glad to see Major Carr; for I knew him much better in India.

Today papa is in Margrönigen John Hesse should have gone to Pforzheim; but is so unwell that he has sent a telegram he could not come; and his lovely beautiful Adele is so ill that one has some fears she may not live, I was there this after noon for some hours, Marie is of course very tired; from bad nights, the little one is so aimiable inspite of her illness. that it is truly touching to see her suffring and still trying to smile. 
Monday Adele is better, Your letter has just come, thanks; much love to your hosts, Since 2 years we buy our wool from Verner

 Adieu dear Son Yours J. G.


1Mama wußte noch nicht, daß more than papu, hats aber geduldig angenommen. Ich kann mirs gefallen lassen, wie Aquila auch hinter Prisca zu stehen zu kommen. Und Prisca ist sie ja auch im neuen Leben aus Gott. Adele war gestern sehr elend, heute besser. Ich denke sie erholt sich bald wieder. Joh redete gestern in Pfzh und kehrte mit mir nach Calw zurück. Der Neuchat. Stockmaier hat dort in der Kirche predigen dürfen, was Dec Gehres dem Joh noch nicht erlaubt
