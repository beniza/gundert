My dear Children [Hermann]

We were anxious to hear about dear Julia God be praised to have spared her to you, That which we asked for you God has given it you; that is full submission to His will to live or to diy, if this is gained all is right, In troubel we lean to know our Lord and our fathers heart, how tender, how good, All that which makes us to know more our dear Lord Jesus should be welcome what ever it may be, The more we know Him the more we wish to be like Him, His love drives away all fears, My dear Tine will have had fears; and the Lord has comforted her with new hope for her Childs life, And gradually through the knowlege of our dear Lord all fears is taken away for us and ours in all trials and afflictions, the will of our father become so good to us, that all that which He will, we say by His grace Amen My dear Lord thou hast learnd obedience in the things thou didst suffer I will learn thee, Study thee in thy humiliation for me so that I may by thy grace be likeminded as thou wast

Yes dear Children we were with you in prayers; and believed that God would thereby come nearer to you and increase a childlike confidence; and learn to understand Jesus when He in Getzemane said if it is possibel take away the bitter cup; however not my will but thine be done, How happy are we when in all things we may so speak with our Lord and father, knowing we are children and have to do with a father, loving father, And dear Julia will also have heard her Saviours voice, how needful it is to be covered with His rightiousness, dressed with His white gown, and Marle will have thought Oh if only she is spared I shall love her much and be very kind to her, 
May our Lord realise all the sighs and prayers which the spirit of God has uttered in us parents and little ones With a hearty kiss to each of you  Yours JG
