My dear wife

I have nothing particular to say, went yesterday and today with Adele out and then to Steinhaus, found all well, and today Julchen came along when I left to see her aunt Dote. She talks of her Papa a good deal and jokingly acts as if she was crying when thinking of him, places her hands over the eyes and cries Uh Uh!

I hope your journey has come off all well and that by 12.30 you were with dear Uranie. We had fine weather on the whole. John had yesterday some migraine but was well enough on the evening today he walked today with me. Carl and Thodo were at Hof Dicke going with the milkboy, they had long been sighing for a vacation journey.

L. Frohnmeyer's braut is a Miss Rommel, daughter of Kronenwirth at Nürtingen, but brought up at Königsfeld, pious and nice. He intends really studying divinity and becoming a minister, will therefore have to wait a long time before he marries. No other news here about, My nights are good plenty love to Uranie and to all the good people you see, the Gretillats, Nagel etc. I hope you don't hurry back for my sake I have plenty of books just received from England, so no want of entertainment. May all be closed happily and satisfactorily to everyone concerned
 Yours affly HG.
