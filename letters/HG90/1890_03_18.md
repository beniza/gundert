 [18. MÃ¤rz 1890]
My dear Julie

Today is the 18 March 1890 and soon the world will hear that something great has happened on this day. Our Bismarck will retire and depose all his offices. Why this is done, I can not just say, it is a secret between the emperor and me. With me it sticks so fast and deep that no earthly power can wring it from me. Today I have got a new hat for Frida, because I heard that Emma grumbles when her hat is placed on Frida's head. But as yet the little one has not appeared before me, so it may be this evening that we surprize her with the present. She had this night loose bowels, therefore her Mama kept her at home during the day. I wonder how she will look at it. - Adis writes most amusing lettres, she learns so much french that the other night she talked french even in her dream.

Quite a new thing is Theodore's resolution to return to his former occupation because he finds it so difficult to gain a fixed livelihood with his music. He now goes daily to Mr Stein and works as a Apothecary there. May the Lord strengthen his determination and give him soon a good place. For where he is now, he gets no pay and works merely to exercise himself in the old trade.

Your Papa seeks now his people for the Passion music on Good Friday. Theodore, Carl and the friend of the latter Mr Ilg are the men that are proposed.

For 1 May Mr Berg is invited and will be glad to come if possible. 
Goodbye with a kiss
 your Opa
