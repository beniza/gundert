+ [An Julie Gundert in Montmirail]
 Calw 22 April 1890.

Oh my Jule what a catastrophe that will be when this correspondence comes suddenly to a stop. I fear the pillars of the Universe will be shaken. But in truth I am glad if I have soon not to write any more, but we converse from mouth to mouth. I never think beforehand how it will be the whole day through, enough you come and we shall agree about the conditions of your existence with us. The Lord being gracious to us I hope never to scold you and you promise that you will tell me openly all how you feel. We can change the hours and the subjects and the manner of treating them till we have found out what is the best way. And then I suppose I give you a kiss and march off for I have no intention to abide for ever here on my sofa. But all as the Lord grants and directs.
 With kiss Opa.
