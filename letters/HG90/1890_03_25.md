+ Dr Gundert an seine Enkelin nach Montmirail

 Calw 25 March 90
Dear Julie

We prayed also for you expressly that this hot day may pass over so that you can thank in the end. It must not be that you be praised as an examplary scholar, but that you have the testimony of having tried to do your duty. - What I said about Bism's demission is of course a joke. Dear Jet asks me sometimes about this and about that, then I answer as if I were one of the knowing, till at last she learns by my laughter that I am as ignorant as other people whilst feigning to hide a secret. Gradually so much slips out that the Emperor was tired with Bism. he liked him and needed him, but Bism is an old tree and can no more bend whilst the Emperor wanted him to be a little more flexible. It seems the Ministers advised the Emperor to try something in order to gain Bism. but he answered: I do not want any more advice on this head. When the breach was declared Bism himself appears to have been somewhat astonished. Now we leave it to God to protect us in some other way since this umbrella is broken. He has many umbrellas in store for all those that trust not in the umbrella but in its holder._...1 
Dear Fanny has again a boil on the back which the Doctor is asked to open that she may have a good night. Now farewell and a kiss
