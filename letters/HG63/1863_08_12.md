My dear wife (and Frederick)

We had to wait a long time until the omnibus moved away, there were however but few passengers and nothing prevented our taking a nap now and then. In BÃ¶bl visited Mr Metzger who loves Grospapa dearly and cares much about the children of his old friend. Here we found David Teicandi who in the morning had arrived from Nagold and reported the Zellers all well. He now nearly forgets Malayalam over his German. His mind is nice and humble, though his habits become of course apparently pretentious, without his having the knowledge of it. Samuel Mantodi feels it deeply how some brethren who loved him in the Missionhouse now forbid him to address them with "Du" - Our own David etc have been forbidden to jump from the bridge into the river. - It is hard work to get again into writing habits so excuse the short letter. 
Calr left this morning with D.T. in the omnibus for Pforzh, he will go to Grupp by way of Lauffen. Paul plays the oratoriums sent by Samuel and is in an extacy about them. The "goodlies" have been admired and are thanked for most heartily by all the 4 boys.

Now farewell; the Lord be with you all
 Your H
