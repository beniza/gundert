My dear wife

Glad to get at last a letter. How long it lasted till you wrote about that Threlfall! Who is Amalia? Did you mean Natalie? Don't care at once about Ã¼berzieher. That may all be done leisurely when you are once more here. Samis letter from Milan will rejoice you. Today Paul will have finished his work, I hope he is cheerful about it Praeceptor had the best prospects for him. Ketterle is in the sick house for swelling in the throat. Marie had some pain in the throat yesterday, but is well today. Miss Steudel came from Liebenzell for a visit. I was this night 6 hours uninterruptedly asleep, and feel much better today than for some time. The Helfer's marriage seems to be delayed by the arrangements of bride's Mama, who cares so much about perfect furniture and similar nonsense. However we get on pretty well. Now good bye from all
 Your HG.
