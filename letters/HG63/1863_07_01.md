My dearest Frederic

Your letter has given me a great joy; for I did not expect you would be able to write so soon. I am glad to hear you have no heimweh I cannot say so much I feel a longing after you specially at the meals, my dear boy is no more by my side to eat, to make me a service when something hard is to be done my strong son is not to be had, but in the other hand I am very thankful you are in a Christian family where the people will be kind to you and love you for the Lord sake, You tell me nothing of your health I trust the pain on the chest is not worse; but rather better, the change of air may be beneficial to you, if you should still feel pain please take at once fish drahn or fish oil it is the best you can take and I would also send you a flanell banian or jaquet if you wish it. We are making your trawsers they are indeed very nice your westcoat is already finished. I had two letters from dear Papa who I am sure will have been as glad as myself and would not gruge the 9 creuzer I am sure I have not seen the Wirzes since you left but will soon go there, your brother with their camarades are as usual not very obedient,

Give my love to dear Mama and to the uncles and also my thanks for their love to you.

forget not to pray God and think not that He does not care for you yea He loves you and follows you everywhere. We remember you continually before Him

My very dear son I rejoice to see you soon and do write us very often it gives us much joy tell us all that hapens to you, your troubles and difficulties as well as your joys Etty sends you much love and I too with a tender kiss your
 Mama J. Gundert
