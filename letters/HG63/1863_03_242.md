Dear Hermann.

Papa has already given you and you and your wife our blessing, may God realise them and give you those blessings you stand in need off. 
Your situation regarding the congregation in Detroit grieves me very much. You are not the person to settle difficult questions it requires a man who has experience and knowlege of the word of God, who has studied Well the Epistles to Timothy and has born the yocke having submited to the will of His Lord and learned to give up his own notions and will Ah poor dear Herman may you by all the troubles which are before you be brought to know yourself and lean on the Lord, on His holy word for wisdom and understanding the resposibility you have as pastor is a fearful one and it makes me to tremble for you.

May God give you in your wife a real help meet not only for injoyement in this world; but a help to fit you for the work and at last to meet the Lord, Soberness quietness, sound jugment are necessary to pasters, that they may not follow their own imagination. Oh dear Son I am uneasy about you, and can but weep before the Lord, waiting for his grace and work. The others give you news of us all so I will but say Adieu to you both dear Children
 yours J. Gundert
