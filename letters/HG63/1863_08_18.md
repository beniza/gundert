My dear wife

No letter from you about Adolf's sayings on Sunday. But it does not matter perhaps as Mrs Deimler writes to the Weitbr's about Rorschach and Imnau, possibly even returning to India and does not mention Stuttg. I have not written there.

Enclosed Herm's latest and a photograph for our good people. 
I hope to come Saturday for dinner, because I must in the evening go to Kirchh, the minister there having offered me the forenoon sermon. 
2 days without Helfer as he has gone to Stuttg to make purchases with his bride. Yesterday Marie dined with David on coffee and pancake, I with Jettle being gone to Stammh. for the Conference. The Liebenzeller were also there. A Methodist from Pforzheim has begun preaching at Liebenzell and makes great stir. The people like him evidently, and come from neighbouring villages.

I hope Paullie is without much anxiety - may he have reached without being rained through. Here all have been refreshed by the rain.

Will you kindly tell me whether you took "Threlfall" with you? 
Plenty love to the 2 Mama's who do not send Emma's letter! and to my Freddy and Paul, esp. to yourself
 from
 Your HG
