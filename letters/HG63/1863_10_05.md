 Calw 5 Oct <63>*
My dear wife

I reached Calw after 2 PM. Marie waited for me at Weitbr's. She has in the meantime had the promise of 3 new scholars in English. The daughters of the Altburg Pastor (Zimmer) had paid her a visit on Wednesday. - I must beg you to pay 10 Fl to Mrs Adolph Mohl for the 2 first year's of her son - he has of course only to expect 10 Fl more for the whole of his stay at Maulbronn; and 10 Fl for each of his years at TÃ¼bingen. Please to send word to that effect. - Then you have to pay to Jette 20 Fl for her uncle William to be sent out to Kornthal (Pfleiderer's) for his Albert. This is the sum due for a death certificate of poor Ludwig which he has sent me. I shall of course forward it to Staefa. - You might also ask Jette for the 3 first portions of uncle's Commentary which he says he sent to me thro' Dr. Comeggs. No particular hurry required still it will be well to mention it as the Dr might otherwise forget to whom to send the Copy. - I hope you have reached Reutlingen in safety and find no difficulty to speak of on our railroads. 
The letters from our boys you may read here. No particular news. Samuel seems to get on well in his English. Herm. in his own chief task. - 
My love to the children. No time for longer letters, but hearty love to all!
 Your HG.
