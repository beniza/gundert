Dear children

I would only say that the end seems near. We prayed together Jul Emm Eliz etc present. Mama exhorted in her prayer: only no mixture, He J. is the fountain, draw out of Him. Make us wise to seek life and life but in Him. In the beginning was the life and the life has no end. Thanks to Him. She seems to have no more pain, is very quiet, demands no more refreshment as before. Otherwise no change visible, but the face more solemn, collected as by a set resolution. I heard from Ernst and Th (E. Pl had written to them) and so we are very happy in closing the day and the week with a sure and certain hope
