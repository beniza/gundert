<? an Bible Socy?>*

 <21 Septbr 1885>*

1I take great interest in the Bible cause, for my father was 1812-54 Secry of the Würtbg Bible Socy. which does I think so far its duty, that it satisfies the demands of the kingdom. It has also contributed as well as Swiss Socies to the printing of the Mal N. T. in 68. I think also of the po‰tical books of the O. T. What seems to me essential is, that German societies care for the people of this land, and learn gradually also to feed more distant nations with the bread of life. But I for one do not see the necessity of having One great Socy. (Does not f.i. the Edinburgh Bible Socy the needful both for Scotld and also for Scotch Missions in foreign parts?) However if a man should feel himself called to work for the establishmt of a Central Socy let him try! The Report of the Würtbg Socy which I join may let you see why our people are on the whole more for a confederation of Socies than for the creation of a new agency. Any how I shall be glad to distribute your letter in some 20 copies. I have yesterday buried my dear wife (after 47 years of union, whereof 24 were passed in India), therefore excuse kindly the shortness and disjointedness of my remarks
