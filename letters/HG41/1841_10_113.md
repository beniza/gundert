Mrs Gundert, Tellicherry, post not pd

 <Poonany-Calicut Montag 11/12 October 1841>*

West I hear left the bangalow only today at 3 o'clock. He will have had the rain and not come to Tellicherry till after this. Ecris moi ce qu'il dira touchant les Chr‚tiens aux Nilgherries, c'est … dire les L. les Roe, les Lawe. J'ai besoin de beaucoup de discretion et aussi de pouvoir pour les rencontrer tous.

Dieu soit avec toi et les enfans et le cher frŠre Fritz Salue les Harris, lui particulierement, et les A. et leur dis que je sentis trop lazy, on etais trop occup‚ pour les visiter avant mon depart. Also boys and girls etc to be greeted and tell Mr Br. that Flora after vomiting repeatedly is well, has not been wet, and that we hope if this bad wind day has brought us so far, the next will do the remainder.

It is 12 o'clock so I will go asleep. After being wet with bed and all, Br Fr's coat has done wonderful service. But if the war goes on at such a rate the poor servant will have deserved a pension at the close of the campaign  Good night! Ton HG.
