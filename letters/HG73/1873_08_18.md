In order not to lose another 2 pce I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your card. You ought to have stamped it as mine is. Glad to hear of having accomplished the different tasks so far. Fr. writes joyfully from Bale and Davy finds that the new husbd marches very respectably across mountain passes. The children with Tine passed the afternoon cheerfully at the Stonehouse, after having heard me in a solemn place. Aunt Hanna is said to have written, plenty news about Major's movements etc

2My dear Papa, much love from me and Mama and Marly. We were very much pleased to hear from you how glad we are, till Wedensday comes so we can see our dear papa again your Julia
