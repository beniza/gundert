Dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your letter, I will speak with Em about shirts and bed, had I known that you have shirting I would have bought from you for the shirts, Mrs Scheffel got it from Alsase. I hope that you come soon and we shall talk together, I trust Mr Z will allow you to come on the 8th and return on the 10th monday, for such short time you need not new cloth, and you may buy yourself the cloth as you like, You shall not make many visits in one day, if you are the sunday only here, Adieu my dear Son

 excuse haste from yours JG

much love from Uranie
