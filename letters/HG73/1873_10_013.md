Dearest Marie.

Many thanks for your kind letter and good wishes, and what shall I say for the beautiful present you made me through David I thank you very much, it is a fine and useful work of yours. you shall have occasion often to see how needful it was and therefore double welcome.

So your sons had such great joy I am glad for them and for you, the vacance will be kept in remembrance by the little ones, I am sorry to hear Mrs Isenberg is unwell please give her my love as well as to Peregrina and Jetthen.

If you come on Friday you shall be well come and can well do without your Sarah till she comes.

Yesterday evening we had Mr Buser and Wöhrle to supper Mrs W. could not come, Mrs Heerman with Marie and Mss Schüz were also to come; and how surprised were we to see Julie coming instead of Mama who would remain with her husband who had just arrived unexpected from Heidelberg, they have been here to day, papa mama and daughters, they were pleased to see their children, their house and all that which consern them. Those of Ludwigshaven came sunday they went together on the Schloss, drunk caffee in the garden, Monday Emma heard that the Verners Professor would come to day for a few days, as Mr H. had already made up his mind to return Tuesday they accepted the visit from Stutgart

It is nice that you have such fine weather you can be out the whole day, We long much to hear from America.

With love to all our dear peopel and kisses to you and Theodor and Carl 
 I remain yours affectly
 J. G.
