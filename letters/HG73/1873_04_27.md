 <27 Apr 73>*
Dearest Frederic

I am glad to hear that you have found such a nice house with good water. To live out of the toun is a great privilege, at least if it is not too far away for you to go to your work

Your good Emma has just been with us the more I see her the more I value her; She will come to help us at the Mission feast. She would have liked to go to Hirsau with papa this morning; but was too shy to tell it and we were too shy to ask her. She shall take tea with us tomorrow.

Did you feel cold these days? with us there is snow and ice are the vinniards frosen in Heidelberg? or is it perhaps less cold than here, We are to keep our hearts fixed on the Lord, be quiet before Him trusting Him fully. He helps you in your difficulties no?

 Adieu my dear son
 Yours J. G.

Papa is not well since some days, much fatigue, too much to do.
