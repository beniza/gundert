My dear Children

Yes dear Tinne your husband has told you right that we shall laugh from joy to see you when you come, You shall find I trust father mother brothers sisters who love you in truth, I already imagine to see Julie and Marie helping me in the house keeping, dressing the tabel, taking away the plates after dinnar, and taking a long walk after dinnar with their Grandpapa who walks daily. I shall be so glad to rest a little and see my granddaughters take a part of my task. Tante Uranie shall be very glad to have some one who will learn and talk french with her; for she has often heimweh because of the language, she loves children very much. Carl feels it and caresses her often saying "ma chŠre tante ich liebe dich."

You know dear children that roses are not without thorns so you and ourselves are to keep that in mind and give thanks for all.

We shall be glad to hear from you how you have found my brother with families, whether frederic think really to come to Europe and at what time. Now with a tender kiss to each of you I remain
 yours affectly JG
