My dear Children

It is with thanks to the our dear Lord that I come to thank you too for your letters which cause us much joy How very different to write now from formerly on both part is it not? We now anderstand each other, love each other in the Lord, are no more afraid to be misunderstood, what a change has performed our Lord He alone has done it therefore Him belong praise and Glory. Let us walk as obedient children to His word. You find now your life and joy in that which you thought formerly longweilig?

The dear Children are looking with joy toward Christmas and Mama is preparing each some what, Papa your grand papa here has wished that one would make no goodle this year; Theodor and Carl shall not come short; for they get plenty from different quarters How are dear Tinne hands I think more of her since mine pain me from cold and Coakx with which I have much to do in winter

My beloved children and G<rand>*children May our dear Lord give to every one of you the blessings which are fitt for you to His praise and glory 
With a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours affectly JG.
