 <8 Mai 1873>*
My dear wife

Only Selam (and thanks from the Essigs with best wishes for your health) 
You had not yet reached Wildbad when Jet was surprized by the news of 100 Centner coaks coming and before dinner the first car came and in the afternoon the 2d. How many had you ordered and at what price? Of course I pay what I am asked for we could not control the measure. We have them stowed away by Ricke and a woman who was very diligent. R. rather doubts about the goodness of the stuff, as there are no large pieces, tomorrow she will try them in cooking

J'espere que ma chere tante ne sent pas trop la mauvaise jambe et que le jour a ‚t‚ tolerable. Nous avons ‚t‚ trŠs joyeux en sortant dehors, mais le matin j'ai fait un peu de feu parceque je ne trouvais pas assez de chaleur dans le vieux corps.

 Goodbye from all
 Your H.G.
