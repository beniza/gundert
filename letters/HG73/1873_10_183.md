My dear Children

Today we were again rejoiced by one letter from you, yes to hear that Jesus is your life is the greatest joy I could ever have, every thing else is but of little value compared to this if He the Lord is our life what can be wanted? Paul says I can do all things through Christ, the believers learn also to do the same, that is to say much, all things. Now that you are in Christ if you will grow in Him you must drink the pure milk the word of God, without this a new born can soon be unhealthy and die away, feed on the word of life is the only way to become a man in Christ, able to discern the spirits and that which may hinder us to abide in Jesus,

My dearest Tinne I would like to hear how are your hands which had already become some what rough before you left here. This time of wayting will have been somewhat trying for you all, but in all these things we learn to look to our Lord with patience and with His help we say after Paul I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me, and my sweet Julie and Marie how are they? are the wats gone is Marie still so fatigued and weak? 
I shall be glad to hear that you are settled at least for the present; May the Lord guide you

adieu with a kiss to each of you
 yours affectly JG.
