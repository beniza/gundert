 Wildbad <25 Mai 73>*
Dear papa

You have much to do I know, as the end of the month is near, at least the time of sending off your work. and you are to preach in Calw and have a monatstunde, So Mrs Ade has finished her course, she had as you said an illness bodily.

I send hearty love to dear Marie for her kind letter, and to dear Jettle for books and letter I shall give her the adress of Mrs Bienemann and thank her meawhile for having written. We shall not return it seems for Wednesday as Uranie does not like to leave tuesday after the last bath. 
I am very glad to have the books. I had a nice letter from dear Frederic, when you write please give him my love and thanks

still 8 days and we shall see each other D.V. I shall be glad. It is less cold than it was troz the rain

Sunday you are in Church may God, give His blessing, I read with joy the epistles of John by Steinhofer, it is really beautiful what light and life! 
I hope Hermann has a good day in NYork. Our friend Mrs Ruckteschell has quickly run to Stutgart to be at the feast of the Diaconiss, poor dear soul, she fears you!

Wildbad is gradually filling itself with strangers, I am glad to hear that Marie has a girl I trust a good one, Well soon we shall see each other, 
We are thank God nicely, I have paid a visit to Klungsinger who has given me some money for the verlag Ver as usual. With love from us both  Yours J. G.
