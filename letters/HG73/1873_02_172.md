 <17 Februar 1873>*
My dearest Frederic

Today you have news from E and Jettle which will have given you joy; specially if Mr. Z's heart is inclined to let you come on the 7th or 9th that is to day three weeks, in this as for all other things we let our heavenly father s will be done, though it might grieve us if it should be other wise than we wish it to be.

I would feel thankful if you would inquire the prices of wine <Pfälzer gut weiß … 50 hiesig. mittel 40>* with you et tell us when you come, we might perhaps get some afterward from there, but no hurry about it, Inquire also what is the price of a bed intire, I mean bed stead <ca. 28 Rost Fl 20.>* matras <Roßhm. 50- Seegras 20->*, plumon <20->* pillows <Fl 5-6>*, if it is not too dear we might give you one from there.

One thing more, till now your shirts are with tow large folds on the chest; and now getlmen have them with very small folds on the front you will have seen with many peopel I dare say, how do you wish the new ones to be done? I can also wait for the ansewr to these questions till you come, only think about it.

Papas cold is not yet quite gone though better.

Uranie sends you love and rejoices with us for you. Adieu dear Son  Yours affectly JG
