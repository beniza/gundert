1My dearest Frederic

Your few lines through Mrs. Sh√ºle g Keiser have just come, You hope still, well it may be so. Em wrote to you to day Jettle has seen her and talked a little on your behalf, it may be perhaps on your birthday may you have a joy one does not know you must wait quietly, should it not be before April take also as from the Lord as we have to take it too.

A propos my dear son regarding Mr. Z you must make it a subject of prayer that God would incline his heart to hear that which you have to tell him about the work and order in the business, if God has brought you in his house to make you usefull and a blessing for his house and business it cannot be without prayers and supplications on your part. God is to incline his heart to give him a desire and longing for more order and so accept that which may be put before him; but without real prayer and a waiting upon the Lord it shall be in vain; but try with God faithfully dilligently, we help you also in this case as it regards Gods glory, let us only be seeking God's glory and nothing for our own satisfaction. He shall care, it may be a time of trial for you, but if you can believe and do it in God and to God you shall have first the profit of it

Adieu my dear Son
 Yours
