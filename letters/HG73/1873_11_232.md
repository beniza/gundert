My dearest Tinne

Your letter has rejoiced us very much. I thank you heartily for it. These last weeks I had more heimweh after you than formerly. I have you often before me, and make me reproches that I have not been kind to you, not loved you as I ought I am a poor creature, God must have much patience with me, if there were not pardon and forgiveness by the Lord what should I become, therefore I praise the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin. 
My brother with his wife were here we liked them very much, they love you and spoke often of you all. they live in Clarens. Uranie in all her letters asks after you.

So my dear Mary has not a good teacher she is cross so you have to learn patience thats also a part of the tasks you must learn I wish for you it may soon be better, and my dear Julia the help of her Mama yes Rikele must bring the bread and carry the letters to the post with many other things which the ameriquen Children used to do, one asks still after you in the town, And my dear Tinne your heands are not good pains, and troubel I am very sorry for you, May the good phisicien help you, I am much rejoiced to hear that my dear Son cannot live without Jesus and His word. May you take all that you want out of the fulness of Jesus for your Church and be a blessing for them

adieu dear Children
 Yours JG
