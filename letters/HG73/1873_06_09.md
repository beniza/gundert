1My dearest Frederic,

We were glad to hear from you, if you can in your next tell me how many shirts you have with you. Emma was some what troubled about your going in that new house, it might hurt your health much, besides they would find it very difficult to send bed and furnitures all that which you may want for you till she comes.

therefore dear Son remain rather in the room were you are, if it should be already rent to someone else you look for an other, if you force the thing it might hinder for the time fixed. have patience dear son if it cost something more never mind you have the prospect D.V. that in less than two months you get your own home, the time is soon passed have pity with your dearest, who feels much for you; and would like to help immediatly but she cannot, spare her and her parents for this short time, and it is not them who should send things for you; but we according to the regles till you be married. I know dear Son that you take well these few remarks from us, and comfort your good Emma who has very much to do and all is for you  Adieu
