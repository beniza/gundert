 <Calw 30/6 - 1 Juli 1873>*
1My dearest Frederic

I have just heard in coming from church from your dear Emma that you have sent me a note, it is very kind of you and I value it the more as Uranie is no more here, which I feel of course. How good, how precious to know that all our sins and mistakes all our faults are cleansed taken away by the blood of Christ. After one has been together for a while, one feels that it has not been always right, at least I feel so, the love is not continuing, coolness and impatience spoil the communion which one might have had. Oh what a poor world it makes me to sigh for the one where sin shall no more exist.

Papa will feel the heat terribly today in Bale.

I am counting the weeks and days till you shall DV. be in Calw, the time run fast, perhaps for you not so quick? however this short time of waiting will also be of use. I think oft of the words of Paul Rom 8,29 for whom He did fore know, He also did predestinate to be comformed to the image of His son, for such glory we are to be prepared and the daily joys and trials are to help towards it Now I have got your wellcome note for which many thanks 
Adieu, my dear son. Emma is I suppose much mouved by the death of her friend Gerber
