My dear Children

We were much rejoiced to see by the papers that the ship which took you in America has arrived safe with all on board, now we look for news from you, and we hope that the Lord is caring for you giving you a good place. We are much with you in our thoughts and talk often of you all, The learge picture we have recieved of our children is very nice, it makes us much pleasure It stands on the piano where Samuel was. Has my good dear Tinnâ€š been seasick? and the dear children those sweet girls, whom I have often before my eyes, In Heidelberg were I have just spent 9 days I heard still much of you all, and we long to hear of you, but we wait with confidence in our Lord who surely has been with you and drown your hearts to Himself preparing you for the work He may have made ready for you. You will be abel to do it with joy knowing and feeling the love of Him who is to constrain you to preach but Christ crucified.

Have Julia and Marie found all their things in order which they had left there? And my very dear Tinne has she much troubel to get again the things which she wants for her house keeping? I had a nice time in Heidelberg, they are a happy coupel, Now my dear children with a tender kiss to each of you I main
 yours affectly
