My dear children <Fried>*

I must first beg pardon for being so slow in writing; but I know that you hear much through papa and others, so you do not look for news from me, and you are asured that I am with you in the spirit. Your letters give me always much joy.

Yesterday evening I was with papa in Steinhaus, there I heard all about your doing, cooking, making sourkraut etc. Good dear Emma we laughed in hearing how you care for your partner, and your papa said "It is quite right he must not have cold feet and he must drink some wine" I am also of his opinion and I thank you my dear Emma for caring so excelently for my my dear son,

The two bed sheets and socks which are still here I shall send an other time as papas bag is full, From my brother Frederic gets two bottons with much love to you both, the cloth beater with a morsel of salt meat and a little tea from the Nielegherree you will accept

I am very glad that at last papa comes to you, spare his voice and talk to him yourselves, It is good that you shall be alone, I wish you fine weather; but especially much blessings, O yes blessings abiding, that is the continuel presence of our Lord with His peace which passes all understanding. Much love to Miss Sch√ºz. With a tender kiss to each of you. 
 Yours affectly
 J Gundert
