My dear Children

Today sunday second Nov came your welcome letter by which we see that things are not so smooth as one might have thought, we are sorry for you; but if it is the way God has found good to lead you in order to teach you know men we are to be satisfied, And now that our dear Lord has opened you the secret to live in Him and from Him you will find that all things work for your best, I am glad to hear my dear Tinne would no more fear to live in our midst who knows whether you are not to come again to us and help your papa. We leave this to our Lord who shall guide you.

We speak often of you all, specially these days that my brother Frederic with his wife were here, we like them we injoyed the short time we were together 2 days only, they will spend the winter in Claran, Unkel Plebst who is just with us heard of the hands of Tinne. Jettle will write you what he advises for her hands, but especially evoid cold water which is difficult for her having no girl to work for her. Many peopel ask after you also in Hirsau where Plebst had the meeting instead of papa, who is in Heidelberg. 
Dear Herman your letter has rejoiced me by showing us how you feel growing in the knowlege of yourselves and of your Lord, distrusting self and dispairing it in onhand and on the other faith and confidence in the Lord increasing daily, this daily experience make accainted with our Highprist and Saviour without whom we can not live So my dear Julia has still the warts I send her as well as to dear Marle a very tender kiss My sweet Tinne I have heimweh after you all.

Adieu my beloved ones with a hearty kiss
