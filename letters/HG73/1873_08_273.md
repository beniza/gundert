 <Calw 27 August 73>*
My dear children <Fried>*

I have not yet written you I know that you have excused me as we had much to do. In the spirit I have been with you and am still. I know and feel that we are united in Him our dear Lord and that we can give through Him each other good things. His treasures are full and we have but to drow out of His fulness grace, for grace, let us only be thankful, yea thankful for all things; for all is ordered for our best.

We have just had the Lord supper with Herman and Tinne, they will tell you all. May the Lord be their light and guide and bring them with us together in our heavenly home where we shall part no more, but injoy that which He has gained for us by His death

I thank you dear children for your kind invitation to come to you, my heart would be ready to run to you; but for this year I must remain at home, about the end of next month we expect Mr Hesse, David is with us now we do not know how long. I keep in mind that I am invited to pass some happy days in your house.

May our Lord give you peace and joy being the first an last in your doings 
 With a tender kiss
 yours J. G.
