 Sunday <26/27 Jan 73>*
My dearest Frederic

You may imagine how our thoughts are with you this day, many sighings and prayers have been directed to our heavenly father that His will be known and done, nothing but His will, however it may be, and that you may in calmness trusting your Lord and father be perfectly quiet, no fear, not shy to speak out, without trying to please any man.

How happy are we to have such a Lord and Saviour,

This morning I awoke with the words strongly pressed on my mind. The bridegroom comes At midnight when all are asleep, He comes as a thief in the night. Who shall cry to those who sleep He comes be ready? Many believers think that the day of the Lord will be preceeded by such things that one will as it were perceive it; but after many parabels of the Lord it is not so. It shall be like in the days of Noah eating drinking being marry. 
Paul gives as avant coureur of that day the falling away, the apparition of the man of sin.

It is good for us to keep in mind, He comes as our bridegroom, may we say at all times yea come soon

Many thanks for your letter, so you have spoken with Z rather be small and no responsability for the present God shall provide for you begin with your 1000 rather that than be troubled in your mind with own commerce, that would take the peace of your heart

God shall help, keep free for any thing Good may give you Let J. M. do alone

 Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.
