1Cher Frederic

Do not think it is a troubel to make shirts for you no; but a real joy, Soon you will require nothing at all from us, the perle God has prepared for you shall have the pleasure to work for you, How kind and good is the Lord toward you, it is good to trust Him and wait upon Him to wait is not agreabel; but it is the way apointed by our Heavenly father therefore good and right

So next sunday you shall hear DV. wheather you can come on the 8th He has given you and us patience till now. He will help father so that we shall praise Him
