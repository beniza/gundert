 <10 Juli 1873>*
Dear Frederic

We would like to give you a clock as Emma has not yet got one See in Heidelberg about one or shall I look here? The ones called the time are the best one says, but it is better you ask Emma which kind she prefers, than tell us what is the price with you and I will ask here.

The time is passing very fast perhaps it appears still long for you, 
Emma has just been here she is in a great hurry. for they have wash and sewing they have still much to do till the end of July. Our Americaner are in Stutgart for 10 or 12 days perhaps, except Herman at once sais I can no longer stay, the ways and manners of other people are untolerabel to him often he is good for America where every one does as he pleases, but this note you distroye as soon as read, for he finds out every thing, 
 Adieu dear son
 yours JG
