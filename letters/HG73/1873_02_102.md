My dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your letters, it is always a real joy to hear something of you though your troubel, with Z do not seam to decrease, the prospect of the future enables you to take it quieter than you would otherwise You had I suppose a good letter from E which refreshed your spirit and gave you courage. Is John M. a converted man or only a brave "fromm" son? To day Julia H. was here to speak with Jettle about their schools, she is very affectionate she talkd frensh with Uranie, who has pretty much heimweh and wish for fine weather to be abel to go out a little, she sends you much love and your Mama too with grace and peace

 Yours affectly
 Julie

I wished to see how many shirts you have; but you took the key away it seams.
