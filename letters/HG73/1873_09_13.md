Dear papa and M. and David Jet

We were very glad yesterday to get news from you all, here one looks for letters with longing; when Frederic comes after kisses he looks whether no news are there, They are a happy cuppel really very nice. They long for a visit from papa. Yesterday Frederic was some what unwell, the Bureau came which gave him troubel, however after the day work which ends at 7 he went to the Yunglings Verei! and had a pretty good night, he is at work again to day.

It is so cold here that one can bear a little fire the mornings, to day it rains much so we cannot injoye the beautiful garden; but we are so happy at home that we are contented, If it is fine weather on sunday we will D.V. go afternoon to see Emelie Sch√ºz

With hearty love to every one of you till monday when I shall see you DV  Yours afftly J.G.
