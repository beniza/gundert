 Sunday <29 Jun 73>*
Dear papa

I hope that you came well to Bale it was not so hot as it is today. you will I fear feel it very much; for here it is as I never felt it. The strowberies in the garden have become ripe in one day.

I hope that Uranie is pleased with the weather, had she been here today she would have got a different impression of the black forest,

Louise Schnürle has just paid me a visit; she sees and believe that God has been very gracious to her in giving her such a husband. He spoke so very wisely and good to Mrs. Deushele who has been in such state that one feared she would become like Mrs. Ade, I saw her yesterday she was better. Mrs. Kapler is still the same Rösele was very thankful to have heard you. The young Marie Kerber is it seems near her end, the parents much distressed. The little girl of Bauman wundarts an unbeliever has died in the Lord, singing hymns of dying, saying I will go Home, she was a pupil of Rösele K on sunday and kept always very close to her during the instruction So the Lord knows his own where ever they may be. Sunday school has been a blessing for her, it gives courage to hear such things

Adieu With best wishes
 yours JG
