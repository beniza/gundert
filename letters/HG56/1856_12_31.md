 Mangalore, 31st Dec. 56
My dear Frederick.

It is now 3 months, that I have received your letter, and have not yet answered it; but now I write this, which David will bring you, I hope you will understand this letter, I cannot write it in German now, because I do not find it so easy; but still I must write to you in German, therefore I must learn it better. Are you learning English? Today is the last day of the year, how gracious the Lord has been to us. May we love Him more. - After a few days I am going to Cannanore again, I will be so glad to see all the people again, and to see again the house where you lived in and where you played, Dorcas, Ruth, Caroline and many other girls are no more there, they have gone to other places, - I was glad to hear that you are learning nicely, and that you are obedient to Miss Culman. I would have liked to send you something made here; but I have got nothing. - Now I must say, Adieu. With much love and a kiss,
 Yours affctly. Margaret
