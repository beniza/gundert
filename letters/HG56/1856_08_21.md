My dear wife

Yesterday I wrote to our boys, Herm and Sam also a word to the Kinderhaus fellows, and sent to Insp. (for Stuttg) one of the photographs, hope it may arrive safe. - After the Tamil meetg at Carr's where I had nearly 30 people, I saw Hodson for a moment, but came soon away as all the officers were sitting in Durbar around him. Carr fears he will only be the good man this time and no Christian. He looks hearty, but some what old. - On Tuesday evening Carr and Brett were evidently prepared for a good scolding, Hoch prayed also much to the purpose, rather strongly. I thought they would get knocks enough without much going out of my way ("Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.) afterwards C. said to Bührer: this was rather strong food, solid food, meaning not exactly the thing for such beginners as they are. Yesterday evening I Drank the 1st tea with Bühr's - Today there is much coaching to Bösinger's the school is closed for her benefit. The sisters complain that Bös. seems to have never thought of preparations no pot de chambre etc in the house

I wonder what David thinks of Chir. If he knows it still and if there are _______________________ etc Love to him, dear Heb. Jac. Nath Sebast Abrah etc
 Your HG
