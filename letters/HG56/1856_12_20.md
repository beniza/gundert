My very dear boys <Fr and Paul>*

What a very agreable surprise I had the other day when papa showed me your portrait and gave me your letter; We could scarcely recongnise you and Marie not better than yourselves. And what a pretty bag or sack I have recieved Is it indeed your making? I keep it as a very precious souvenir, has Paul worked any thing in it and what is the part my Frederic has done? I thank you very much for it. I am much pleased to hear that you are learning pretty well, I hope that soon my sweet Paul will become dilligent. Imagine what David said when he heard that Paul is still idle, "Well if Paul is idle I cannot love him" If you are not running quickly after Frederic David will come between you and you will be the last. He wanted to write and thank you for the nice little books you have kindly sent him; but there is no time remaining for we are already late.

My very dear sweet boys I send you plenty kisses
 Your Mama Julie G.
