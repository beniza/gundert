 <May 1856>*

My sweet and dear boys!

I have but a few minutes to thank you for your nice letter of the 17th Februar. We are much pleased with it, et we rejoice with you of the visit of your Uncle Theodore. I hope by and by you will see often your brother Samuel. It is very nice you are learning so many Hyms I wish that they be not only in your memory but in your hearts. David is learning some too; but he is not fond of committing to memory he gives me a good deal of trouble to come to it. He has just now a great zeal to learn to write with Herman one of the Catechists boys of whom he is very fond, he sits by him at school and even during the meales he is by him, I am rather glad of it: for we have taken charge of two little girls who give me much to do, and your good Mimi Miss Will is living with Mrs Hoch to help her in her school! She will write to you next time meanwhile she has charged me of plenty salamms for you.

I hope dear sons you are obedient and pray God for a new heart! 
With much love and kisses from us all
 Your Mama
 Julie Gundert
