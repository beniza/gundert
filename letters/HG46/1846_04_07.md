 Basle 7 April 1846
 Tuesday evening

My dear wife!

Only a few lines to tell you in all haste that I received dear Papa's letter with your enclosure, May God soon restore our dear mother with the children. I part this evening for Staefa Ludwig will have heard of my arrival through his Minister, who I am told stands in continual correspdce with the Basle friends. I had a long talk today with Mr Spittler and the young Mann who brought your letter. Tell the children to be good till I come, also dear Marie must be quiet in her bed and all will be well in time. Sunday <5 April Palmsonntag>* afternoon I preached in the Martins church, exactly on the same day <12 April Palmsonntag.>* as 11 years ago. I am pretty well satisfied with my visit, have also had my portrait drawn for the Committee room. Rachel has a little boy. Christiane is Daniel's wife, Marian the wife of Matthai. Both did choose for themselves. The schoolmaster in ___________________ Jacob is baptized and believes, has also got his wife and children again. With love to all
 Your HG.
