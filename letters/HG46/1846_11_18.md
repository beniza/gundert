My dear wife

In your letter received yesterday you wish me to answer quickly. I herewith do so. In the hope that you will execute what you promise and take care of yourself I now permit you to come with me and may the Lord prepare our way before us. -

My mother says: she hopes you have a cloak? If not I hope you have one made and everything what you want: only not too modest, I beg you! As the Committee will pay 600 Florins for your trouceau! Spend money as much as you like, I will pay it back to you when we meet. Only that after all you do not say: Oh if I only had purchased this or that.

Jane Müller, Frederik M's bride, is with us at present: and pleases us much. She has nearly made all her purchases.

And now may God keep you. Chr. sleeps. The boys are playing, for it is Wednesday <(18/11)>* afternoon and only __________________________________  All salute with
 Your HGundert
