 <ca. 21 Jan 75.>*

Many thanks Dear Children <Fried>* for your kind letter, As you get papas letter you shall know all about him, Jettle told you I suppose that Miss Thomas had sent a telegram from Malta saying that they would come to Genua next monday the 25. Therefore we can expect papa next Wednesday. Today the Nagold has past her usuanl bane* and one feared it would overflow; but except in few places it has remaind in its limits. Bergfelt has visited us today, he knows all about Mr. Thomas wife. Did you know the matters yourself? he had to pay all the expenses of her divorse, he is pretty much in debt, she is a real lady; she had a bad husband. and had to suffer much from him, she had a great number of Children. All his relations are against him because of this marriage, As she had nothing to live she became house Mistriss in the mad institution where his mother is, there Thomas made her acquintance. She has been brought up in a Moravian institution is well educated. All this I have just heard from B. Well we shall see what a sort of girl she is. May the Lord help that it not be in vain her coming here. Adieu my dear Children Theodor Schn√ºrle is well, now and than tooth fever, but on the whole he is growing and becoming strong, but not so much as your dear Julia to whom as to yourselves I send a hearty kiss.
 Yours JG
