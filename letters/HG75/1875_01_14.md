Dear papa

Today Marie remains in bed as moving about brings again vomiting, she is not worse, Friday, Marie had a good night and feels pretty well. Carl is with us likes your bed much, when he heard that he was to sleep on your bed he said: but if my grosspapas bed was going to crack under me what to do? he is nice one feels that he under discipline, at dinner as he look at his soope displeased because it was too much, he refused to pray at once papa took his soop away and gave him none at all, poor fellow revenged himself on the meat and vegetabel.

From Stutgart Jetthen wrote that she would gladly come; but her Mama does not allow it. Yesterday Mrs Hayd Stadtpfleger died after 14 years of illness Magen Kr√§ps, Johannes cold is getting better. Mrs Mayer was much pleased at Mrs Muthel's letter, she had felt that there was something strenge in her faith, she had told more on her visit there than with us.
