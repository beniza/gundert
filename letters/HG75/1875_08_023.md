My dear Children [Hermann]

I have to thank you for two kind letters which give me always great joy. That Christine is my daughter there is no doubt and a very dear daughter I only feel unworthy to be called mama or liked as a Mama, I hope the bath which she takes so gladly may be beneficial and blessed for her health and hands. Uranie sends you 100 francs and I the same <Mama sagte mir so, ich beschrÃ¤nkte es aber auf 20 Doll. (Gold wie ich hoffe)>1 to pay the bath for dear Tinne.

That which you relate of dear Julia being so compassionate and friendly with the poor maltreated boy <(der kleine Graf.)>* has touched me very much God uses her already as a missionary, she is willing to do as you did take up the bundel of a poor old woman and carry it for her, these are signs of grace in Children's young hearts, parents can have no greater joy that to see how the Lord makes His way in the heart, Your dear children would like to be with our new girl <"Christine">1 a fine sweet christian girl who likes to speak of Jesus to all those she meets She is very delicate so that we spare her having one woman who brings the water and to do the hard work, our new girl Christine knows how to cook well is carefull and econome I hope, every day after dinnar I send her to bed for one or two hours, as she could not continue the whole day at work; for she is very dilligent and we hope that with some care she may get stronger if God gives His blessing. Our poor Rikele had become almost unsuportabel with her ill humour, we were all afraid of her, if after all the things in the cookroom are a little less shining it will be no great matter; for her pride was to have all clean and beatiful; which I also like; but not thereby hinder the use of the things for beauty sake. May God give her knowlege of her own heart and repentance to life. David has come to spend his sunday but I see little of him, there are brothers and sisters to be visited; but we are glad to sit at meals together with him. I am glad that the unrightiousness committed to Marly at school has been known I send her and to every one of you a tender kiss
 yours affe J. G.
