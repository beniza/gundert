 <20 April 75.>*
My dear Children <Fried.>*

By a letter of Uranie I hear that they intent with Frederic and his <Mary>* wife to leave Neuchatel the 13 Mai be in Heidelberg at 4 Ocl no more so late as last time they go of course at the hotel at least Frederic with his wife and Uranie if she was to troubel you, if she can be with you I would be glad as she might find difficult to reach you from the Hotel, they intend to spend the 14th with you and come to us on the 15th Till then I shall write to you there is still 4 weeks; if it is fine weather Mary will of course see all that which is fine in Heidelberg. Today we expect back our dear Steinhauser; and rejoice to hear all about you, Dear papa cannot go out he has much pain in the back as he never had so strong, he cannot turn himself so that the night was restless being obliged to lie on the back the whole night; however he is now in his study room moves about with much difficulty He is as happy and merry as ever tell spass with grimaces on his face on account of pain. he will have the Verein at two as John with Marie are in Stutgart to hear Smith Genny keeps house during there absence, she is a fine creature we all love her much; most conscientious with the Children which is not quite according to their tast nor custom, she is very kind to them relates stories; and amuses them sitting with them on the floor.

Adieu my very dear Children. with a kiss to you three
 Yours afftly JG.
