 <Wildbad 2 Juni 75.>*
My dear Children F and Emma

Many thanks for your kind letter I think like you that in your new work there will be trifels, small things in a day work which may bring the hearts nearer or farther from each others, it is to be expected it will not be very smooth; it is good that you are prepared for it, And the Lord can make it to be better than one anticipat; however with the Lord all is possibel, if His love constrain us it makes all easy: and to have papa near to feel you can help him much controle all other unpleasant feelings. Mrs Zi s room is very near us I can see her room from our windows. I have just been at her door, but the son was still there so I went back to see her afterward

Your Julia is doing with your boots what David used to do with those of Col Young, even I think he took his salive to rub them with, as they were so beautiful shining.

Please God we shall meet after some weeks altogether, as David spoke once of coming at the end of June.

I have had a talk with Mrs. Z. who was very glad to see me I have promised her to come often.

Now with hearty love to you both and kisses to you three
 Yours affectly JG.
