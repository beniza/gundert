Dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of 27 Oct, Last time I wrote you about our Christine being ill she is again well God be praised, she is a true child of God, very thankful to be in our house,

So you are also now and than tired and cast down by work and by peopel, I know what is that and how heavy the devil can make it from inside and outside, but what that? the daily fight, which shall continue more or less till we have overcome. If Jesus is near if the soul and spirit rest quiet in Him it is pretty easy a look on Jesus help, faith brings down new courage new joy and one exclaim, be of good chear it will soon be over, but when we feel as it were left alone, how heavy and difficult; however to Him be glory He helps again and again so that after all, there remains but praise and thanks for His longsuff[er]ing and great patience with us, The victory and crown is for those who fight in the same way as Paul did that is weak in self strong in Christ. I am so glad that God gives you joy in some souls in your congregation, any how the fruits shall appear Jesus is not preached in vain the seed shall spring up in Gods time.

The difficult time for you is winter with school and house being together, Kartoffelen we have from Baden they require one hour to boild, in WÃ¼rtemberg they are bad in general, from Zwetchke we have made many cakes in the very blechh Tine had made while you were here, one has had a great quntite of prunes and pears, less Apfels, We get wine from Alsas

Now that the provisions for winter are nearly made one shall have more rest 
With much love to dear Tine to the two pets and yourself
 Yours JG
