My dear children [Hermann]

We were glad to hear again from you. Can dear Tine bath in your town or has she to go far what qualities has the water she uses? I wish that her hands be restored intirely and her body strengthened! You say that you are a lump it is right: this knowlege you had not formerly; the more we advence the more we see that indeed we are lumpen and wretched peopel, therefore we learn to understand what is that be dead with Christ and burried with Him. You got once very angry when we spoke of having to die, it was just before your going to America. Now you begin to distrust yourself, your imagination and wisdome and all that which you have and are, So that Jesus can take His seat in your heart and rule guiding you from moment to moment, Be not discouraged of doing nothing good, the Lord who has now his tempel in you shall do the work, let Him only do with good confidence, May His word abide in you, and fill you. Friederle does not find quite his present work so smooth and easy as supposed For old age is bound and chained with customs which form the second nature

Uranie sends you much love, she will soon return to her home 
With hearty kisses to you four
 yours affectly J.G.


1Dies Bflein ist nicht eine Antwort Mamas auf Dein letztes - wegen Steinhofer. Einstweilen la√ü ich Dich auch Sam's Handschrift wieder sehen. <(19. July 75)>*
