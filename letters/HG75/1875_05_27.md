 Wildbad 27 May 1875
Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind letter. I had heard from Annele that Rick repents she had done it already the first time; but before us it could not come out, so one must not hear too much from Annele, if she had been bad against me only one might try to put up with it; but it is against all those whom we like, against all the missioneres, and those of whom she fancy to get no reward, in fact I think that she hurts our house and Gods work, as long as she is not converted,

Last year the musik costed 3 f this year f 4.40 or 8 Mark, the milk 16 creu per Mass while with us in Calw 8

From the first of June one shall take here no fl nor creuser nor paper, all new mony I am glad that you gave us only Gold, if it is the same with you please look at the money which I have in the bureau some belong to the poor and some to the Mission it must not be mixed. In the drowr behind at the left hand is also monney for the poor, the one at the right hand in the inward drowr belongs to Uranie and to me nothing is to be changed it is all good money. Perhaps the change is not made so quickly with you as here. 
Now pardon this barbouillage I can not write more my hand pains me. 
Much love to all at home and Marie with hers

 Yours affectly J.G.
