 <C 5th March 75>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

I must not forget that it is my dearest Frederic s birthday, and though I am wishing every day for him some good thing from the Lord I owght to do it more especially on the 7th yea my very dear son we have not only to pray to beg; but much to praise and thank, what has not done our Lord for you these two years? and we trust Him for the future, and hope that He will inabel us to praise for all His doings in our behalf. should they not all be according to our wishes nevertheless we shall recieve grace to praise His name for all. You will have heard how many are in sorrows in Calw for having lost their children, they are not lost; but so speak the world, I pity specially the poor Schwink who has none remaining of 13th he had, the last four have died in these last four weeks, I come from the burying of Rikele Reinhart a fine soul who has worked for her Lord in humility as the Decan said on her grave, I loved her sincerely.

Papa says that I should accompany him when he goes to you I do not know as yet, if one gets retour billet for some days, it will all come right, Mean while accept my best thanks and best wishes for yourself for Mama and Julia With a tender kiss
 yours JG.
