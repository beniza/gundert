 Wildbad 31 May <75>*
Dear papa

Many thanks for all the news pour Miss Th may the Lord soon open her eyes and give her repentance. Your plan about our return to Calw is quite right we had already thought of Saturday or Sunday evening. I do not return you the letters of F and Emma it might become too heavy as Freder has sent me these inclosed, he wrote a good long letter in English, gave also the address of Mrs Z

I thank dear Jettle for her kind note and information about a new girl, I hope it may go with this mentioned it is not needed to wait for me to settle the matter after you have seen her only inquire from her dear Jettle whether she can cook par exempel cottlet, make use of old meat, make liver or those pieces of Calw meat as we have often the evening, can she also work in the garden? this she may learn from our neighbours and our garden is small. Surely to get a pious person is very desirabel for our house and some wants of knowlege if she is willing to learn may be far better than the perfection we have, now, if that girl please you and papa rather settle with her before I come as R might still hope and trouble me. Much love to dear Marie and all the friends there in the house and Steinhouse, With hearty love
 yours affectly JG.

My note to Mrs Zeller you may send if you think right
