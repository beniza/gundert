1My dear Children <Fried>*

We were again glad to have so good news of you all, the baby seems to make great progress, Yesterday I saw the little Theodor Schn√ºrle, he is no more little and mager; but has round cheeks, very merry and healthy, sits on the pot de chambre very quietly is nearly clean, the grandmama cannot praise enough her little son, the father laughs in speaking of him, the mama is bruiante or exited in showing the babe while the father seems to say the Lord has given me faith therefore he lives, the babe is the picture of his father, You will like to hear how we are going on with our Miss, but papa can describe her better than myself, she is a poor thing, however she puts up better with then I expected, her dog is an unclean little beast which has no regard for sittingroom nor any place, he sleeps in Rickeles room on a bed, she is a nice dog very intelligent; but we would be glad to be free from her. Our Ricke likes Miss Th because she is friendly with her, salutes her, while she does not like Louise D whom we all like very much, but R says she is a proud girl this Ministers girl Now I must say Adieu with hearty kiss to you three, We have much disease in Calw many children die
