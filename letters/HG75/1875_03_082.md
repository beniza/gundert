My dear Children. [Hermann]

I have to thank you heartily for a kind long letter of the 10 Febr; it contains your monday way of living; I think it is nice and easy to wash when it is so fresh and not kept for weeks in the dirt; but we could not do it, and for the present I shall give my wash out of the house as long as Miss Thomas is here, Rikele has too little time to help. Your present with a little bit of Uranie would be sufficient for a clothwringer; but I wait till Christine can help us; for I still live in hopes that you come once, I fancy to see poor Marle weeping as she saw the fire so near your house, God be praised to have spared you, it is good that dear Tinne was quiet I do not know whether I would not be much excited and loose the presence of mind in such a case. <Nein Mama w체rde stark sein im Augenblick und sp채ter die Folgen sp체ren.>1

Now the spring is coming I long for it hoping I shall feel less nervous and also to be able to remain in our bedroom alone which I like much; while in winter we must be together in one room and our Miss is a great talker and I do not understand half of all she says. Lately I have <(s. Papa's Brief)>* been often in one house where 5 peopel have died in four weeks just now are lying tow children dead on one bed they shall be burried together afternoon, their four last Children of 13 they had have died of the Scharlat fever with halsbreine, this epidemie is strong in Calw and many die specially children

At once the weather has changed, yesterday the windows so frosen as they had not been before and today so warm that one can have the windows open to get warm air. Adieu my very dear Children great and small with a tender kiss to each
 Yours affectly JG
