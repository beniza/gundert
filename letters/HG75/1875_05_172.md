My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your welcome letter of 14th April. Zahn who got your kind salutations returns them warmly, Yes as you say it is difficult to bring the saviour to peopel who have been so brave during their life; to become really a poor sinner humbling oneself before God is a rare thing, however in these last months God has worked much through Pearsall Smith, Many have been revived and many converted, these great blessings are an answer to our prayers of the two last years. In England the work seams to be still greater than here. I hope that the Lord is giving you joy in His work that you may not get discouraged and faint. Many have laboured hard and long before they have seen fruits of their work, the needful is to be faithful, the spirit of God alone can quicken and change therefore much prayer for the holy Ghost is wanted. I think much of dear Tine if I could forget her a neighbour of us a good christian woman would remind me again of her hands; for when I shake hands with her the roughness and often woonds of her hand grieves me; but this woman thinks that she would be ill if her hand was well for formerly she had pain in her chest and coughed. My dearest Tine thinks also her heavenly father is right in all that He does, if only she grows in His knowlege and abide in Him who is her life; for He helps from day to day to carry the cross put on us, and her dear daughters help her too besides papa. Uranie is here to go to Wildbad Frederic with his wife brought U. they are today in Heidelberg from where they return to Sweizland to bathe <irgendwo bei Zug>*

Adieu my very dear Children with yours kisses to everyone
 Y J.G.
