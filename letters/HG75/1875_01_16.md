Priya Bhary‚

Yesterday evening I went to C<orcelles>* where Uranie received me with Timoth and a lantern, you may fancy how slowly we went up to the house where I had two hours talk with her. Slept where I had been once before. In the morning after _____________ down to Gret. where I met R. I saw Gr's child, returned to R's, took something and started for this place. Here I received at once <from M M and Mr J who came to the gare> Your telegramm which is older than Th's but may contain some unwelcome truth that I ought to have been earlier on my route. Any how I intend passing the night here to take the train from Geneva to ___________ which lands me there about Monday morning, and then to search with the help of Fds to whom I am recommended by those whom you know. Mlle R has been here to enquire after you and soon I am to go to her to finish the conversation She is very well for her age, J better than I expected.

 Goodbye Yrs ____.
