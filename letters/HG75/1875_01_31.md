 <31 Jan 75.>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

Today sunday you are also writing to us, You will be wanting to know how I find our guest or Miss what shall I say? a clever girl who knows it and is pretty full of herself. to my feeling she is a poor thing who knows nothing of the Lord and does not seem to have any wish to be other than she is. I fear the troubel may be in vain; however we are to do our atmost with Gods grace and leave it to Him who has the key of the heart to open it to hear His voice. The dear Louise Dorshe is an other creature who gives us truly joy, humbel, ready to serve, to hear, she loves the Lord truly. Miss Thomas brought a dog which is very nice; but vex us with its unclean habits, for Rikele has already enough to do without cleaning every moment. however we will have patience and take quietly that which the Lord gives us to bear hoping He may bring out of it something to His praise in us and in our Miss; a lesson we have to learn and do it that is be minded as our Lord was Philli 2. first down, humble, obedient and wait upon Him. Papa has hard fight, he does it with faith and patience

adieu dear children love and kisses to you three Yours affectly  JG
