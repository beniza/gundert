My dear Children <Fried>*

I quite forgot in my last to tell you that Mr. Schtolz was here to seek for a logis, it is not quite deceded whether they will come here or in Shondorf. he saw a loging in bad casse which pleased him well in a new w√ºrtzhause Shumacher, papa Heerman who visited us today sunday said also that it is a fine nett loging. We did not incorage him much to come to Calw, as things are rather dear; it is still to be seen what they will do. Marie is better however when she is up she feels very weak, some pain in the stomack because she has no stool without medecine, injection even do not help, after eating she feels a preasure in her mag, the more troubelsome is that they have no girl the one they have now to aushilfe is but till lichtmess afterward what to do? Jettle and myself are more troubled about it than themselves, however we are to trust the Lord who shall help for them and for us with the expected Miss Thomas, In a letter to papa in secret he complains much of her, so that she may cause us troubel or soon go way, this for us alone The Lord may turn things differently than we unticipat, this as all other desagreabel things we are to accept as from our Lord and wait upon Him Oh for the mind of Jesus, who said always with joy not my will but thine be done, this lesson is to be learned every day fresh, may I learn it joyfully Amen.

Adieu my very dear children with a tender kiss to you three yours affectly  J Gundert
