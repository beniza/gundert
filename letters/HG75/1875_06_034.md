My dear Children Hermann and Tine

Since a few days I am with Uranie in Wildbad, it is not my choice to come here; but it may also be good, At least just now I am reading a book which I could not have done quietly at home, it is First Oxford Union meeting, in which a good deal of Pearsall Smith is to be found; I like it much specially what he says himself; after others have been talking of their feelings and somewhat excited, his calmness and fully rest in Jesus, does good it is like a mending that which was wanted in the former speakers, his doctrine somewhat blamed by Blumhart and Kapf seems to me the same as my good Steinhofer who after the Bibel is all I want, only Smith presses more on what he calls consacration which is clear in Rom 12.1 Surely we want in our days more earnestness in our christianity, Paul understood it when he speaks of being dead and buried with Christ. mortifiing the body keeping it in bondage less he be rejected after having preached to other, if we consider what is ment by so many exortations to renounce self, to mortify our members and affections, we must conclude that without this or at least a fervent desire longing for this consecration we cannot truly say and feel after Paul I live not, I, Christ lives in me.

I occupy most of my time here in reading I have also the "vier yahre in Asante to read for the second time to read it well one wants time at least for a poor reader like myself.

how glad would I be if your dear Tine was with us here. We do not walk much about as we are both idel and it is pretty cool this days Uranie sends you love she rejoices to hear of the goodness of our Lord to youward having been found by Him and living to Him.

With hearty kisses to you both and dear Julia and Marly
 Yours JG
