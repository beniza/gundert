My dear Children <Fried>*

Today it is so cold and winter like that I shall not be abel to come to you if the weather continue so; however we live in the hope to see you here with your dear baby who is the attraction in part of your visitors. I have been in hope even that it might be for good your comming here, now things seem to be otherwise; however we know nothing and God can change all of course it would have been a real joy, to think to have you so near; but if we have like in other things to give up our own desires and will God shall help that it be done willingly and not by constraint. Were you here papa would have some one to go with him to Hirsau and not like today that Emelie was alone with him to her joy, she continues to be as ever even worse; that is a part of the cross we are to bear,

Herrman's letters are very nice how one feels that he lives in Jesus and for Him. Our Miss is intertaining Jettle, she can talk fearfully I wonder at the patience of J sitting for hours hearing her nonsence; that is a poor creature indeed, believes herself to be a beauty and a wonderful genie, My good Emma will wonder when she hear her. O what a grace that none of our Children is like her

Tomorrow shall bring us news from you I hope and of the dear Julie, which we long to see, Mrs Wirz has been very ill and is not yet well has a bad breast

Adieu my very dear children yours affectly
 JG.
