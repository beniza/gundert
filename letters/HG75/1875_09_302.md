My dear Children [Samuel]

Your last letters gave us much joy, by hearing of the new hopes the Lord gives you, I can understand the joy and the feeling of gratitude with which your hearts are filled and we praise God with you, As also for the blessed time He has greanted dear Samuel, to get a broken heart and a Contrite spirit, appears to me one of the greatest blessings we can recieve, that grace is some time given me at night after I have been some hours awayked from cares and different thoughts as just now the approche of the winter provoque cares which one has not in India, to get the many needful provisions for the winter After the restless season, God graciously shows me my foolishness and sinfulness in not trusting Him for all these small little things, how small is my faith before the mountains which might be remouved with a look to Jesus. It is really humbling to think of the patience and long suffring of the Lord.

Some weeks ago I was in Stutgart and saw your dear peopel Mama rather troubled about Caroline whose servant girl had run away, you may imagine the poor Caroline with two little ones in a small carriage, her shop and house keeping. if she had not your peopel near what would she become? 
These days we had many visits two and 3 at night during several days, Marie has also often visits, during two days she had pain at one of the breasts and feared it might give a long story; but thank God with cold compress she soon felt better, They are all well also in Steinhause.

With a tender kiss to you both I remain
 yours affectionatly
 JG.
