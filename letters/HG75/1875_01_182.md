My dear Children [Friedrich]

I thank you very much for your kind letter, if I have not writen till now it is only for want of time, since papa has left we have had much to do. Carl is with us, he sleeps on his Grdpapas bed, he is very nice sings fine hims, repeats bibel verses, he is a fine child, the education of papa profits him much, more than with Theodor Papa left thursday morning you can see his journey by the two Cards which he has sent, As Samuel writes that Miss Tho was to arrive at Genoa on the 10. papa will have to seek her and probably shall sooner return than we thought, Marie is not yet well though better than she was, they came every day for dinnar, their servant girl is ill so that Jettle has been there and has runed about to seek a new girl, even till Hirsau and Stamheim. Jettle will tell you all, We have had wash to day so I feel tired and let her tell you all in details. All that which you say of Julia interests me much. I send her a kiss as well as to you both, We have again very good news from Herman, one feels that he grows in the Lord and lives from Him and to Him

Adieu my very dear children
 Yours affectly JG.
