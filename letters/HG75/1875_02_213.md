My dear Children <Fried>*

We are always very glad to get such good news of yourselves and of the fine good little girl, Gustave whom papa has seen yesterday in Stutgart spoke very heighly of your prachtful Bursh We rejoice with you for this gift of God, it is our turn to rejoice and give thanks, while many round us are mourning over some little one who have been taken from them, This morning died the fine boy of our neighbour Nashold 3 1/2 years old, the only one they had remaining, in several houses Children are ill with the scharlat fever and halsbraeune. By Dreiss where Marie lives the three children are ill; but what do I write, you have all these news from Steinhause and much more, Papa is now in Hirsau I can no more go there with him to my great grief. I have not the strength for it; but perhaps in Summer I shall feel stronger, meanwhile I have many opportunity to hear; morning and evening and able to read myself; if hunger and thirst is there food is abundant. Poor Mrs. Zimm. and her Sister how good have we compared to them I do pity them; may God work in them His good pleasure, to be abel to humble one self is a hard work God alone can do it. I wish this for Schwink who has burried two children this week

Adieu my very dear children with a kiss to you three
 Yours JG
