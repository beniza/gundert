 <5/6 Mai 1875.>*
My dear Children [Friedrich]

That Uranie does not come to Heidelberg you have heard already Frederic with his wife shall come to see you after having been one or two days with us, they intend to come on the 11th, we shall let you <determine>* which time they come to you. Mary wishes to see Germany so she shall go about in Heidelberg no doubt; Now I write to beg you to be so kind as to send me one of your new shirts, a dirty one as it is to be used for pattern for David, if I remember well he had one of yours at your marriage or afterward and he liked it is it not? he is in want of shirts.

Still 6 weeks and we shall Dieu voulant see each other, I am glad to hear that you were pleased with Mr. Smith no doubt he is the means of great blessing, I look at it as an answer to our many prayers for such a season, I am sorry that Blumhart did not like it, had this revival come from his quarter all would have been right, the spirit of the old brother is in several still and the warning ought to be considered less the firsts be the lasts. Steinhofer and Smith have the same spirit.

I have seen the hut and dress which have been sent for your pet. With a kiss to her and yourselves
 Yours affectly JG.
