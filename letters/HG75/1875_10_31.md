My dear Children [Hermann]

Today papa is in Gernsbach for a mission feast. David did not come this sunday as usual as Frederic is in Stutgart for a visit, we are rather glad to be alone as our Christine is in bed today, I begin to fear we shall not have her very long, she coughs a good deal and is very delicate, Your good Tine would have laught if she had seen us cooking, first Jettle said she would make the dinnar, which consisted in a rice brei, for the soope we had bouillon from yesterday, After Jettle had kindled the fire it would not burn; so I went in the cook room, to help to have it burning by taking away the stones and ashes which hindered the fire, after a while came Miss Thomas who also said what sort of vessel one should take to cook, not long after ward came Louise Dorsh who proved to be the best cook at once the brei did not boile and it would have been time to eat, what was the matter? four of us standing by, there was no more fire, we of course had a big laughter at last the noodelsoupe the brei, a small meatcake and carry and rice were finished the carry had already been made yesterday, we have eaten our meal with pretty good appetite. My good Tine I do wish I could cook; but I have niether strength nor desire to learn, what you considere as a small matter in cooking is a mountain before me, So at night as I felt some what troubled about the health of our girl, I thought where is my faith if this one cannot cook shall not God give us some one else, it is easy to believe and speak of faith as long there is no trial for it, but when it is tryed I see how very little faith I have; The one like a grain of mustardseed I have not, the mountains which often stand before me are not often remouved. Oh I am a poor creature, God must have a great deal of patience with my unbeliefe

A letter from you has come we wait for papa to open it. With a tender kiss to you four
 Yours J.G.
