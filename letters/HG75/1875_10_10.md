My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of the 15 Sep You are very kind to take the troubel to write me seperatly I thank you very much. The Almira "Kasten" is of a great use to us and fits our room beautifully it is so large that it contains several forein things beside those which were in the samll one of Emelie Seeger.

It was not at the church door that I told Hesse "Das MÃ¤dele ist da" but at his housedoor as I opened it to him, I was rather excited as I was alone with Marie when the girl made her appearence on the chair were Marie was sitting having not had time to get to bed before it came. I kept the babe on my arms waiting for someone to cut the string or to take the babe from me; it took pretty long before the midwife came who then laid the Mama on her bed after the Dr had cut the string, had the midwife been there, there would have had no need of the Dr; but I feared to cut the cord myself. it is a fine nice girl who smiles and is brave. But the one of Fred is most amusing, very cunning, she draws the attention of her G'papa by all sorts of noise or grimasses, and is indignate if he does not take notice of her, she has a fearful will of her own beside much amiabelity at night. when she wants something, she claps her hands together saying bitty bitty papa or Mama. The love for there two girls does not decrease the one we have towards you no, the contrary, how glad would we be to see them together and my dearest Tine I thank her for her love to me and hope that the good she has got from the bath will be permanent

With a tender kiss to you four Yours affect
