My dear Children <Fried.>*

That you may have a few lines from Wildbad after having heard of the wonderful Julia what a joy it will be to see you both coming with her or when we shall come to you in Steinhause she will soon know her Grandpapa G who shall throw her about and jump. I shall be very glad for papa to see you at his side helping Him, how remarkabel that you whom he carried about so much with cares and deep feelings of sympathy should be the only one in our famely abel to help him. On both side it will be with thanks to the Lord, it has been for him a hard work to bring this to pass I know what nights he had till the pettition was written and past over about your calling to Calw. We both felt that it was from the Lord and it costed a good strugel to have it accepted; but the Lord has done it to Him be thank and praise, papa did it just at the right time perhaps that later it would not have been accepted without many objections,

Now in the name of Him who has been so gracious will we meet and live together helping and loving each other, With a tender kiss to my sweet Emma your dearling and to yourself I remain
 yours affectly
 J.G.

Much love from Uranie
