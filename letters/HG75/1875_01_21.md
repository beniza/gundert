1My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of the 29th De, I am very sorry to hear the the hands of dear Tinne are again less well; we have a neighbour woman who has also in one hand such thing. she is a nice pious woman who works in the Cigar fabrick, her husband is catholic a correctious man one of the girl seems to have something like the mother on her head quite a little girl, you see how much there is to thank that your dear girls are well Yes dearest Tinne you are right our troubels are slight and tolerabel compared to so many others O we have much to thank may we always see how good we have and be thankful,

As I am writing Carl is near me singing many hims, the whole he is repeating bibelverses and of God, he is a very fine Child, improving very much, I have ocasion to see much of him as he stay with us during his Grosspapa absence he sleeps on his bed at which he is much pleased, Of Maries illness you have heard already, and as Jettle writes instead of papa she will tell you all our troubels about Maries illness and her servant girl. Carl is just singing as loud as he can, if you believe in the Lord Jesus you shall be saved with all thine house, he makes himself the sung all about God or His word and sings very loud. Of papas troubels Jettle will of course write, it is no pleasant thing to make such a journey in uncertainty, 
Carl is just singing Oh w√§re ich ein Missionar und dabei a coch; he is a very different child since there is a father to educate them, specially it is visibel in Carl more than in Theodor,

Uranie writes that Frederic Dubois is far from being well She is herself much rejoiced at the prayer meetings which they have in Corcelles, the minister as well as others seem to have been awakened and are full of life and zeal, the old christians who were so cold and indifferent are revived and there is a new life. O may we also feel such revival in our midst that the old christians accustomed to meetings and much talking need such revival is certain, power, Strength is wonted in our talcatif christianity, one feels often it is mere words without power and spirit May God visit us and give His spirit who alone can work such new life in the old brothers and make new ones,

Much love to my dear Tinne to your pets. Yes Tinne you must believe God can give you an addition to your family wait on him; but say, thy will be done
