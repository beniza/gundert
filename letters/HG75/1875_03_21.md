My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of the 27 Februar I am sorry you got no letter for so long a time; but afterward you will have been rewarded by papas epistels, which you shall injoye still a long time I hope, About our Miss you have heard already the more one sees and hears the more she appears poor and empty of all that which fits not only a chirstian but a useful member of the sex; papa surely is telling you all, the lessons become daily greater that is the lesson to renounce to one self to deniy one self to take up the cross to follow Jesus, this is to be learned afrish day by day, not only with Miss Th alone;

I hope that March and April shall not be too hard for dear Tines hands I think much of her as our work is increasing. Rickele does not without murmering some of the work which the dog and her Miss give repeatedly; but as she is paid extra for it she does it, Miss Dorsch gives her no work. but she does not like her she has something dry which Rikele takes for pride, we were thinking to change as she has become really impudent and intolerabel but the difficulty of getting a good girl makes me to have patience beside she tries to be better since she knows we would get an other one If David comes to stay with us I shall try to get a laufmadele to assist Rik for our household is too much specially in summer when we get many visits and the garden must be done I can no more help as formerly; caring is already too much. Theodor and Carl are just here playing with the dog which hides herself, for the boys are rather rude with her, your girls would be inchanted at her fine manners,

With a tender kiss to each you I remain yours affectly
 J. G.

In my next I shall tell you how your present has been imployed you shall see it I trust
