My dear Children [Hermann]

We were quiet pleased to get two long letters from your dear girls Mama can use them to write and to work for her how very nice, if they were here now they would chear their Grdpapa who is not at all well, since 10 days he has much pain in the back with fever, there is some inflamation in the lawparts of the stomack, to get up or to mouve is very painful, however he would make spass or jocks with his grand daughters were they near. From Uranie we hear that she comes with Frederic and his wife in the middle of Mai, they come only to accompany Uranie and will return to Swetzerland to some bath, while <Ur>* will go to Wildbad, At the end of June we shall have full as David will also come the Heidelbergers will live in Steinhaus; John with Marie were in Stutgart some days to hear Mr Pearsel Smith they liked his discourses well, and many people have been really benefitted, may God greant that the fruits be abiding to Gods Glory. We have been long praying for a season of refreshement for all Christians and the world, I hope that the Lord give you joy in His work and shall make you a blessing for many, the secret is to abide in Jesus drowing from Him continually grace for grace out of His fulness

With a tender kiss to my beloved Tine to the dear daughters and yourself  Yours JG
