My dear Children [Friedrich]

Many thanks for your last letters, It was much of you dearest Emma to write, for I can understand that you have no time for it, as your darling is to be served We are amused at all that which you relate of her, she is certainly much advanced for her age, the little Schn√ºrle who is soon 6 months is nothing like it. We will thank God for the joy He gives you and take all from Him these many good days and like wise if less good should come afterward We are happy to know our heavenly father cares for us, let us take every thing as from Him it be agreabel or not.

I had joy to hear that my dear Frederic has paid visits to Mrs. Zimmerman, she may wants some good words in her long illness, love will surely do her good from you both, you are not there in vain, may the Lord give you prayers for them, please give her my love. Marie is still in bed, it is really touching how John cares for her and the Children, they come often to us for dinner as their girl does not understand cooking

Adieu my very dear Children with a tender kiss to you three
 Yours affetly J.G.
