My dear Children, [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last, I was very glad to hear the hands of dear Tinne are not worse, and glad to hear that Jesus is your joy your life your all. Yea every day more precious and sweet, a high tower in time of troubel, a refuge a surety when the roaring waves in the heart would like to crush and swallow us up, when at night tossed up and down like by waves, Jesus is so good and says "peace, be quiet all is right I am in the ship", then we feel and know that He is our life and overcomes for us.

The Lord has put a burden upon us which I could not have born formerly without murmering and trying to throw it off as soon as possibel, now without Jesus grace and strength I could not bear it willingly; but He helps from day to day and makes it to appear lighter. That is our Miss <Thomas>* and her dog, She, full of the world of self and vanity ignorant and empty of God' knowledge, the dog a fine little beast intelligent; but unclean respects niether Oehrn coridor nor sittingroom, I told her she is to take him out now and then, she did it on the stair case where all the peopel must walk "now I said she must take it to the priv‚, or in the garden;" but it is full of snow; however this will also come right, if Jesus is precious to our soul His yoke shall be light and His will our will, these are small things I should not have mentioned; your Julia will laughs at G'mama and dear Tinne will laugh too. but so weak I am and my Marle what does she say, We are in the winter again after having had warm days. Adieu my very dear Children and G Chil. with hearty kisses
 Yours JG.
