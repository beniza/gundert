My dear Children [Hermann]

In my last I could not tell you of my joy, for I had not yet heard of the good news which rejoice you and us, so the Lord has greant yours and our wishes, what shall say the dear girls to see a brother or sister in their house? Dear Tine I feel so glad for your sake, it is also a mark that your health is better. I wished papa to send you the money I had mentioned before for you will have some more expenses; but he thinks that you are going to recieve some from Mr. Steinkopf, however you have but to say a word, I hope Julia and Mary have a happy Christmas with many presents I feel really sorry that they have nothing from us, while every one here get a trifel at least, no goodle; for we make none, were dear Tine hear she would make them for me, however I eat none, papa does not care for them, the little ones get plenty from other people so we are excused.

Now with a kiss to each of you and best wishes for all that which concerns you now
 Yours affectionate JG
