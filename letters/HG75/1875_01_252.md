My dear Children [Hermann]

Your last <(v 4. Jan)>* recieved today <yesterday 24 Jan>* has given me much joy, The Lord is very gracious to you, the secret of taking daily out of His fulness grace for grace is known unto you and with this knowlege we have the key of all our Lords treasures, So we know the meaning and value of Pauls words, "All is yours" What a precious thing it is to have Gods word when one has hunger and thirst, live from the word so that we realise gradually within us that word, which becomes our bread, so that in good and bad days our will and desire is to do Gods will that it be agreabel or not sweet or bitter. His will not with must; but willingly chearfully, yea our Lord will work that in us so that we may in some measure say after Paul I live not Christ lives in me.

Marie is not yet well she gets up; but is weak, her stomach in desorder after eating feels uneasy, happily that he is pretty well to care for her; but the difficulty with a servant is great since weeks one seeks for a girl; it is really a great troubel; she should have a good woman who can cook and care for the house, both of them understand little about these troubels and are pretty quiet while Jettle and myself are seeking and going about Jettle went in Hirsau and Stamheim in vain

My dearest Tinne my neighbour suffers a great deal of one hand just now she reminds me of you and I feel grieved for you

Carl after 8 days with us had already lost a good deal of the benefit of the disciplin of his papa. So that it is good to go home again, he did care any more to do what he was told With much love to each of you four and kisses
 Yours JG
