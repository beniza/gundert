My dear Children <Fried>*

Many thanks for your kind invitation to Uranie I have written to her of course the others go in the hotel they spend their life in hotels so one lets them make only tell them which may be the best and not too far from you if possibel.

Papa is not better as yet; but he will not keep the bed; for it is also painful to be obliged to keep on the whole night without turning oneself, pour papa he trys still to make spass but his face betreys the pain, there is inflamation in the low part of the body and the fever keeps the sleep away; but he will not try any remedy I hope also that it may soon pass. 
Yesterday the Stolz were here they came Friday, their furnitures came happily yesterday morning so that the evening they could go home, it is no small thing to have 4 children so small, pour Emelie it is a hard task, we had enough for one day, the boy specially is not very treatabel His mother is to come these days then Elise who has been with them hither to will go to GÃ¶ppingen one year to learn, poor Mother of S. who is 66 shall not be abel to help as Elise who did much, all the children are very fat and strong. We have a hard week before with cleaning and Mission feast; if papa is getting better never mind work We will wait upon our Lord He shall help 
Adieu dear children with hearty kiss to you three
 Yours affectly JG.
