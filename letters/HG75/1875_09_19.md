My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your kind letter of 4 Sept, So dear Tini has been with her daughters to Detroit. I hope they had joy and I hope to hear why dear Julia loved Lydia Traub; and so the protegâ€š of your dear girls came again I hope he may get something from them not only for the body; but also for his spirit and soul. I trust that the bath will work on dear Tines hands and the whole constitution. I write you but a few lines; for we have visits dear Tante Reini with her Miss Robinson, the first was exceedingly glad to hear your letters and she sends you hearty kiss One of her eyes is quite lost; the other is weak she has to spare it; she is very nice she has also been benefitted by hearing Pearsal Smith, she went to Hirsau to hear papa today 19th The two last days I have got 15000 Torf for our winter; it will amuse dear Tine to hear of so many and it was a great work to bring them up on the soller. for the winter we have still to get potatoes which are this year not good by us, we get some from Baden, then get wine from Alsace or from else where the Autom is somewhat troublesome on account of the provisions one has to store up, and still how thankful am I to be that we have money to buy them all,

Now I must say Adieu with a tender kiss to you four
 Yours affectly JG.
