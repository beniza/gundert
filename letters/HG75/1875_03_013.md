My dear Children <Fried>*

Many thanks for your kind letter and kind invitation to stay with you for some time; but I shall not be abel to do it, as Uranie speaks of coming again to Wildbad so of course I shall be obliged to stay with her there, As the spring is soon to appear I shall be then stronger I think; for the winter trys my nerves very much. I already feel better since it is less cold. To see you and your dear child would be very nice but we hope that dearest Emma will come with her Julia in Summer so that we shall all see you. When I relate by Schn√ºrle the wonders of your pet they remark that their son is backward compared to yours, but he is growing stout and strong, smiles give them less troubel at night, is specially friendly with the grand mama who can not praise him and speak enough about him. When she cannot come to them one has to take the child to her.

Poor Mrs. Zimmerman the time will appear long to her; may our Lord speak to her and comfort her till it please Him to help.

Adieu my dear Children, with a tender kiss to you three
 Yours affectly
 JG.
