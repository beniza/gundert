 <Calw 8 April 75>*
My dear Children <Fried.>*

Many thanks for your well come letters. In Calw it is already known that you are coming, Emelie Seeger told me that it is for them all a very great joy, I doubt of it at least for her own self.

About the loging one has time to consider of course that for dear Emma her own home in her parents house must be far desirabel, so we will no more talk of it; but leave it to God who shall guide you aright.

This morning as I was with Widman he said he was glad of your coming and hopes you will make the things with <for> Weitbrecht as smooth and easy as possibel, treating him or dealing with him with love, regard and esteam, he sees now that Weit can no longer be alone nor shall ever get abel to do the work alone. We may soon count the weeks till you come, as I did formerly when one of the children was to come. Julia will be injoying her stay in the garden which is also good for mama. It will be a great joy to see Mrs. Heerman with Marie I wish you good days together. With love and kisses to you three
 Yours affectionate J. G.
