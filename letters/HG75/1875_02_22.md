My dear Children with Grant Children [Hermann]

Today we were again refreshed with a letter of yours, the experiences which you make with school and peopel are helping you onward, though they are not agreabel, but you feel that the Lord is helping you to be a witness for Him to which we are called. witness for Him thats a great privilege, we should rejoice in it and be faithful that this witness be accepted or not. 
To be abel to take, to accept from the Lord daily momently all that which comes without displeasure is a great grace, We might learn a great deal were our eyes opened to see how the Lord lead us from moment to moment. 
These days it is very cold with us, the windows frosen, there is also a great deal of sickness among the Children SCarlat fever with croup or halsbraeune, many infants are dying of it, in some houses two and three. Our Miss Th has a cold; but she keeps herself rather well and trys to be at home with us at least it seems so; of couse she lets feel that she has descended very low in coming to Calw but for one year it is tolerabel. she teaches us to make different sort of puding dear Tinne could help me to have a propre dinnar for her, however she accomodates herself as we have with the addition of pudding. A special kiss to the pets to Mama and self 
 Yours JG.

Your Children would like the dog Lotte, she plays nicely, is quite white with long hair rather small
