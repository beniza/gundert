 <Calw 2 April 1875.>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

Papa will already have told you how well we came home with out feeling cold nor fatigued, The picture of your little one always before us. and your dear faces and kindness and love

Yesterday evening in talking with Jettle we came to the thought that perhaps we might live together I scarcely venture to think of the sacrifice Emma would have to make, however I will tell you. If you could put up with the two rooms where Jettle lives you know them in one of them you had your first entrevue, in our sitting room we all shall have the same right and if you would take the charge of house keeping I shall of course humbly and submisively help you in what I can. We would than take an other girl who might live peaceably with yours, and be under your direction; perhaps it would not be necessary that she be perfect in cooking as yours knows it and being two the work might go on well. If you think that this arangement might be possible I shall thank the Lord and take it as from Him as a season of refreshment and rest for body and soul, Jettle would than live where Marie lived and our two Miss in one of the rooms in the sale, at that time there shall be only one I suppose as the time of Miss Dorsch would be over May the Lord guide you in these matters as in all others,

With love and kisses to you three

 Yours affectionatly
 Julie Gundert

Julia Heerman has just been here I told her what I was writing you about; on one side they wish you in their house on the other what with Miss Emilia and the familie Fecht who usually spend their vacance in Steinhause. You will of course hear all about it. In both houses one has room and warm hearts for you.

 Adieu my dear Children
