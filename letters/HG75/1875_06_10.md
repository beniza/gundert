 Calw 10 Jun 75
My dear wife

My letter was already gone to Zug when yours arrived. I hardly think this bit of addition sufficient for another, I had also written to dear Frederick a little and suppose he does not want particularly our medical advice. May his spirit be cheered and comforted.

You can leave Wildbad 5.30 in the afternoon, are at Brötzingen 6.10 wait there (or at Pforzheim from 6.15 - 7.15) till 7.19 and arrive here at 8 o'clock. We will assume that if you do not write again, you come here at 8 o'clock. I also think this better if you do not regret the hour in the quiet Brötzingen.

Elise remained the whole day in bed, but talked most cheerfully with her people. I did not try to see her, lest she be too much excited. 
Fred Müller was here on his return from Nagold. I had to settle with Mrs Zeller that I go there at 2.30 in the afternoon and farther to Altensteig in the evening. From there we return Sunday evening to Calw but you must not wait for us, we come after 10 and sleep. Monday morning you can then talk with Mrs Ramseyer very quietly for hours.

Miss Th had today her first piano lesson with Miss Fecht.

Jette gives her orders and lessons, but I see little of her. You know that Julie H and Emilie Schütz will accompany me to Bale So I wrote for them to Frohnmeyer hope he settles it nicely.

Goodbye for the present With love to dear Uranie
 Yours HGdt
