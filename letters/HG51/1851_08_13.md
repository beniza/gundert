Dear papa

Hebich has just sent me this one of your dear papa on his birthday. I send it to you in haste therefore cannot write much. We are very sorry of the news concerning dear Pauline <(Irion)>*. I have again no letter from my sister it greeves me much. I am going to write to her. Thanks for yours of the 8th just received. I am glad you have given up the idia of Salem. 
We are all pretty well. At Anjercandy all is well says Hebich At Tahe the deseise is at end; but Israel and his mather are blind. Having heard that you have hope to return in october we talk daily of the return and Vau seems to understand it, and is getting wormer towards you both. he is better and sleeps well again.
With love
 yours afftly
 J. Gundert
