My dear wife

Yesterday I sent a letter. Today having received yours of the 13th with Papa's I send this merely as cover. You may read all and have it read and then send to Mögling as before. - Bührer went this morning to Kaity. Möglg has persuaded Lehmann to cut off his beard, but he seems to have repented afterwards - poor fellow! he found Scripture reasons and what not all to defend it agst Deggeller for a considerable time. But that there was vanity in it, he could not see. However I do not think he will let it grow again. But what would in such case to have been done with Dietz. I only trust he will never think of it. - I hope your sister will soon give some news. She may have heard of the Carawan and therefore have sent a long letter with other things for them to take along. - I have written to Papa and Samuel this very day, to try once the via Trieste, which way Mrs Buhrer continually writes to her parents in Würtembg. Do not trouble yourself about the windows in case the workmen have left already. Well I trust you have peace in the house, no disease and a quiet mind. May Grace abound to you and  Yours HG.
