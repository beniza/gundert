My dear father

Many thanks for your letter, indeed I have not yet learned well to take bitter doses without, anger, or against my own will, may the Lord teach me to submit to His will in all things. - Vau had a dose of oil again, his stomach is still in disorder, he gets Eddy's little bandy now and then as it comforts him and makes him quiet for a while, he asks for* things which do not agree with his stomach, he does as Etty did formerly goes to sleep with a piece of bread, rice, or meat in his mouth - still he runs and plays, he has a great pleasure to take a walk in the evening, Davy gets no more milk; but he has not yet forgotten it, sometimes he asks, by pulling the button of mamma's dress. - Give our salams to Etty, and tell him, we think that he is a good boy as he washes his head without crying, Vau sends alam to Etty and papa the girls send love to you. Tomorrow I will put the seeds which you sent me, I remain yours affctly
 Margaret Will
