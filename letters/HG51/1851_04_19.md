Plenty Selams for the short cover of the 13th April. We shall remember you tomorrow on Easter. I shall write these days to Ostertag and also to the Committee giving a short extract from your letter to me about the feast, that they have something meanwhile. To Ost. I have begun to give sense. The Comm. wrote to Buhler that MÃ¶<gl.>* had reported an "untruth" about Kaity - all mistakes of their own, for they read not attentively enough. But M. does not mind it much. So you see that I have determined to stay some months longer. I hope when the rains once pours down, you will be able to write a bit now and then. - Give my love to the Youngs and all the friends - We are always glad to hear of any of your doings in the Lord. - I am sorry for Joseph's Eliza, but the Lord will surely do what is best for them. Nath. is going on well and I believe recommends the Gospel to those who have intercourse with him, in all humility. - We have no living native Christians here. The mother of the girl that is to come to us is perhaps the only one! Pray for us, as we for you
 Ever affly H Gdt
