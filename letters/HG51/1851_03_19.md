Dear papa

The Vandy man having just brought me your letter I haste to join one line of thanks for it, in sending you these letters which have just been returned from Tallipuram. Dear Hebich is very happy till now no stones, no noise, no beating, all are quiet and hear the word of God. He will return on wednesday morning. I am glad to hear dear F puts up with any thing so well. Mrs I say that he should have some shoes with doble soles I shall send one or two pairs as soon as made, she speaks also of having worm trawsers under, if you think it necessiary I will send some, but having long flanell banians as he has I did not think it wanted, chiefly during the hot season, other children I have seen on the hills with very few clothes, let me know. Natha write to his wife that Fedd is pretty well still his motions not good; but they will get right gradually I hope. David's vaxination is very nice and he is not troublesome as I expected he would be. Paul coughs a little, but it will soon pass I hope, both are troubled with prickly heat, Mrs Muller writes that her 3 little ones are covered with boils, He has come to Cannanore for the preaching. the Chumbala Mullers will return to their place on monday she has been a full month at Tellicherry to help Jane who's little one called Anna is still bigger than all her others children. 
Now with kind regards to the whole house Kisses to baby
 Yours J Gundert
