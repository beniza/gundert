My dear wife

Only a few words in haste. Yesterday Friday morning I left Kaity <Koterghery>* after receiving the enclosed. Got the parcel in Kunnur, and found after opening the Macassars, that only one was somewhat coloured by the picklejuice. I have lowered the price of this but raised the price of the others. Arrived at Kaety all well, met on the road first by Ir. and then by Mör. Mrs Ir. appears better. Her hope is now risen, since it is certain they go next week to Coimb. whither Dr Porteus has kindly invited them. Nothing particular here. Only I heard from Ir. how strongly Huber longs for Palgh. They must have had a disagreeable meeting at Tell. Fr. Müller was also some what out of the way. May the Lord give us love and patience according to our want.

Now love to you all. As I am going in to Ooty I have no time to loose  Yours affly
 HG.

Fr. laughed when he saw me leave Kaety. he was to go with the Bührers to the Cockb's plantation on that day.
