 Chir. 24 Oct 51
My dear wife

Only Selam and the news that all is right. David very well satisfied, when I visit him, does not cry at night, but play occasionally from 2-3 in the morning. - The box for the school has arrived - I opened it, very fine dolls etc as Miss K. says who will take care of the whole. She would have kept it unopened for you, though it was addressed to her. But I could not understand why and so opened it -

Mrs C. M. has written to you about 7 Cotti* beurre and shoes. I shall try to settle with him tomorrow. Miss K sends best love, Fred. his Selam chiefly also Alam to Vau and the dear Bührers'. I am anxious soon to hear that you arrived safely and that Christian is well again - Now farewell  In the Lord
 Yours HG
