Dear papa

I just received yours of the 13th I must have made a mistake in writing to you about the bilding Hebich intends to do, it is not for the boys, but for the brother <Diez>* who is to come to help him, the brethren have told him that he ought to be in his house. I am very sorry to have made you to think that the bilding was to be for the boys. The sickness is now at en end all are well again. I write in a harry as I thought to send only tomorrow; 
As I have made the mistake I will not show the letter to Hebich. The day I told you Cpt Car <Carr>* was excepted he did not come; but came this last thursday He is pretty nice he said on questioned where he had been converted that it was here at C. and he added it remain still to be proved whether I am truly converted. I wish it and will do all what is in my power." I then said God would also have it and he requires from him obedience and faith. Hebich spoke great deal about Election. he was very clear and Car seemed to have understood him.

I cannot write much at present being late already but I hope to do it on monday. Do you think Moegling right in all what concerns Herman A.<nandrao>*? of course in this case Hebich is against him and I can anderstand why. but there is probably some what wrong in both party. Now Adieu. We are all well and remember you more then ever before the Lord who will soon work for you
 Yours aff. J. Gundert
