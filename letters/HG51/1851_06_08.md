 <Pfingsten>*
Dear papa

As you have much to read in the enclosed I will but say a few words. Thank for yours of the 31 recieved the 5th June, letters were pretty long going before what will be now, during the rain. I shall be glad if my lace can sell at Kot. Tell dear Sophie that Frdy has so many trousers because some time he required 6 or 8 pairs in one day when his Ambac* was out of the way. I am glad to hear such good accounts of him. I hope to hear soon the same of yourself!

I would have written to Sophie; but I am rather tiried with dear David who has been a little unwell these last days I am not sure if it is teething or the change of weather his bowels are rather loose and he is restless; but I trust it will soon be over. I will stay at home to day because I would not be able to profit of the preaching with him. As he think me the best nurse of the world! Paul is well and very merry, runs out to the rain continually, whe I say Paul you must not go to the rain he sai no no in laughing and in speaking even he runs to it. Yours of the 2d the Vandy man brought on the 7th evening. I am sorry I cannot give you news; for you know that I never mind any thing. I have been born in a village and accustomed to look but round me. I have too little of what you have too much; but so it is farewell
 Yours J. Gundert.

the wind was so strong last night that it broke many plantain plants in our garden
