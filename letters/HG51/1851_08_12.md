My dear wife

This is only to send you a Selam. You know that Pauline Weigle's mother died the 10th June - in a happy state of mind towards the close of her life. P. took it very well, says W. Ir. wished nearly to have his wife here and to try our Dr (a Bombay man for a short visit of 2 months) - but he has no instruments with him and can not undertake the case. Dr Johnston does not come at all to see her as promised, nor would he even admit Ir. when he paid him a visit always "no time." She has no pain, no discharge, but tendency to continual weeping. - Lehmann had a most stupid beard which he brought to Mang Mglg etc were much against it. At last he took it off. Otherwise I do not see how Heb could have visited the next GeneralCfce! to face such a rival would indeed have been a task! Some one, I think Mrs Bühler, has sent through Mörike a bottle of Sugarseeds (Carraway comfits) for Freddy. But he is very stingy with them and will not communicate properly poor fellow - What a hardship to give - how blessed still to receive! - We thought of getting Mrs Irion here in case the Dr could have done something for her. Now they will perhaps have to go to Ottacamund to be nearer the Dr there. - There is here nothing particular to tell. The mail has already arrived! so I am looking for letters by and by. I hope yourself and children are well. The Lord be with you -
 Yours HG.
