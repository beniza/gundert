My dear wife

I just now got your letters - many thanks. I send back in haste. there being just an opportunity Eliz's letter, and hope she will take a lesson from this and strive to do better in future. - You ask my <mind>* about Joseph. I have told my mind years ago and see no reason to change it. - Frederick was very much pleased with the Nondri. Foulkes and Sanderson rowed him. Still after some time he moaned for Nanni, and when he landed related to him all his experiences. - The next day I visited Dr Schmid with him, for I had given N. leave to go over to the Bazar and buy something on the market. He walked pretty well, What he could not walk I took him on horseback, viz. on my back. So he was very happy, ate plenty of meat returned yesterday Wednesday morning with me. - Today Gründonnerstag <17.>* Papa's letter came, I have hardly read it, all good news, I shall send tomorrow, opportunity offering, but will not detain this. Fred. is decidedly better. When Bührer comes I shall write about staying: wait till then. If Cugnen is not better I wish him not to be baptized. Let his wife and mother rather be taken before him.

Now farewell. They are waiting for me at dinner. -
 Yours HG.
