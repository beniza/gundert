My dear wife

In much haste I write to let you know that we arrived here safely this morning. Friederick grew somewhat melancholy about sunset and broke at once out into a sigh, followed by asking twice for Mama - but I quieted him and he slept well. When he awoke the Nondris of Calicut were all in sight, with which he was much amused. He spends his day very quietly with Nath. This morning we sent off the Coolies. MÃ¶glg had packed up the books, which Young gave for the Dr's so I could not deliver them, of which I was sorry, perhaps I may send them from Ariacode. We had dinner together, Huber just returned from Coilandy. His children have a kind of eruption. Fr's boy is stout and seems happy. The horse has arrived about noon all well it seems - I wonder how dear Vau bears our departure and hope you give him a good example

Now farewell - love to all - I hope you had a blessed Lord's supper. When I come to the Nilgh I shall look out first what the views are about our stay. Irion is said to have remarked that probably the room will not suffice in Kaity for both of us (M and me) then I shall try Kotirgherry - but address to Ottacamund. The Lord keep you in perfect peace!
 Yours HG
