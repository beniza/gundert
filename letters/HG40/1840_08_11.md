The Reverend Mr. Gundert, Tellicherry.

 Anjarakandy 11th August 1840

My dear Sir

Michael Vellay has enticed away two of my Pooliar young men whom he has taught their tasks* I suppose, for the purpose of uttering accusations against me. From the circumstances that have transpired against Michael Vellay, whatever these boys can say, can be no extenuation of what he is accused of; nor any guarantee for his having conducted himself in the manner he has done amongst his flock - I am confident your good sense will see the drift of this conspiracy forming against me, their master, and that it is actrialed* by - maliceous vindictiveness.

I hope Mrs Gundert and the Infant are both doing well
 Yours truly
 J. Brown

Mr. Hibesh <Hebich>* left this at 9 o'clock, rather a bad time for travelling, and the day has been sunny. I hope however, he will reach home quite well. I was pleased with his conversation.
