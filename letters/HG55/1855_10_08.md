My dear boys

I enclose you a letter from David, who is always "a free and happy child". Though he often repeats the words All my nature is unholy, pride and passion dwell within, he does not look much humbled by it. Mr Hebich sends you plenty love. We wait anxiously for the Owen Glendower which brings to us not indeed our dear boys, but at least their picture. How we shall like to look at it. David will not go to Europe, except he get a whole box full of sugar: and even with that promise he wept the other day most bitterly because Mama said, she could not go with him.

Well dear Sonele I hope you are happy without sugar, and obey aunt Culmann and learn diligently that you may one day come and help us in our work. Bella has little ones which David caresses and carries about as if they were his own children. One little dog we sent to Helenele at Tellicherry, was David zu Thränen rührte. Als ich von Tell. kam, begegnete ich 2 Giraffen auf der Straße. Ich mußte meinem Gaul das Gesicht bedecken sonst wäre ich nicht über die Brücke gekommen. Mama küßt euch, und so thut  euer Vater
