Dear papa

As Fredric has written you already a long letter and had plenty news by Mr Moerike, I will write only a few lines to say that all here is as usual. Joseph still fevrish, Searl and Stocking went this morning to Tallipar. Paul speaks of a fine Bramin having come to hear the word; and took books to read. Tomorrow the whole house goes to Cannanore as Missy wish to go and cannot walk I ask Mr D to be so kind as to send the Vandy than all shall go I mean our children and I of course. I just here that Irion is to preach tomorrow. Muller has brought some chocolat; but no saddle I have not seen him. When you write tell me when you think of returning and whether Mr and Mrs Fritz are coming If the Weigles are with you give them my love, as well as to the dea Hochs

As I am in hurry with cleaning all about I will say good bye David asks when will papa come in order to go to Vilatil as Etty says

love to all
 Yours afftly
 J. Gundert.
