Rev. E Diez, Cannanore, Bearing

3.) Mang 21 March 52

My dear wife

Here are Papa's and the children's letters. I send them through Diez that he may read them and give you the interpretation as early as convenient to him. You see that Hermann requires a strict hand over him, so we have to pray the more for them. But do not write to him about it, because Grosspapa does not wish it. - I heard this morning a Canarese sermon of Mögling - very nice - our work <Liturgy>* makes progress I hope I may finish this week. Weigle will sell me his very nice pony so I hope to be able to ride with more comfort after my return.

I have bought 3 dozen of slates from Hoch and hundred slate pencils: and paid for the wool

Nothing here that is particular. I am glad Samuel made the remark about uncle Adolph Mohl, how comforting it is for us to know that he died in the Lord. Now farewell
 With love to all
 Your HG

The boys here seem happy and learn Canarese. In the evening they sing english songs from Cannanore - All is well etc - Schönen Gruss from Möglg Weigle etc - My love to Hebich and Diez
