My very dear Eddy
and sweat Vau!

I mam, write a letter to you both and tell you, that I am very glad to hear, you prepare your boat to come here. You must know, that you want your Palankeen too, put Bread and Fruit into it, the journey is a long one. I am glad Eddy's Bowels are good, and that he soon will be able to read. Good Eddy must not flog sweat Vau, and let you both, have Bishop a share in your play. No doubt, Eddy will have so much Buddi to unterstand, that I can not come to him as long as it is Mounsoon, afterward we will see what can be done. Many Kisses to all the three dear boys. Does Eddy like to pray and to hear Papa preach?

Adieu dear, dear Eddy, many salams from your Mam.

My Chr. Regards to Mrs. Young, Mrs. FitzGerald, and to all the good people at Cannanore.

Many thanks for Missi's note, love and salams to All, the children the Cook and Nathanael.
