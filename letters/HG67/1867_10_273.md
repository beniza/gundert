Dear David

I hope to morrow to hear from you. I do not know why I have more heimweh after the children now than formerly; and I see with joy that there remain but 8 weeks to see each other D.V. I hope you are happy in the Lord and in good health. Do you come often in Olgast or in Höhe St? Grand Mama is of course very happy to have a baby in the house and is most time down I suppose. Have you joye and peace dear son? Do you find in Gods word food and strength? The 8th ch of Luke in the parabel of the sower we can see why Gods word work so little, and it is still often the case even with believers. how many things hinder that precious word to live in us, if even one has ears which hear, which is often rare I must still pray for such ears which car hear.

I am sorry that Emely Muller will soon leave us, 2sie vergoß auch etliche Thränen darüber. Nun aber Lebewohl Es küßt Dich
 Dein V.
