1Dear Marie

Again good news the Lord be praised, so you had twice to quit quickly Karachi on account of Mr Shirt! in future you will see better and take rest when given you, if he had been a few days unwell without you it would also have been not so roung. Now he will soon get his wife, you have now been already two years in Hydrabad, and the Lord has spared you, perhaps now that you have accoustemed your selves to the climat you may be abel to bear it well, however dear Marie take care of yourself now and do not ride on horse back or Camel you might easily provoque a misscarriage, and you would feel that it weakens much more than a real birth, you are to care more than some one else because your back is weak. So your ama has become Aya, your darling should have long ago been at night with out drinking, many peopel give them nothing more after they have passed the 4 or 5th month I was told by peopel who understood well to bring up children that if a child is well and strong one should not give any thing at night except cold water after the 4th month. I could not do it; but went on as you have done almost. though I felt and knew others were right, besides the rest one has the children strive better. Our story with Louise will Jettle tell, I have much to humbel my self, it comes hard upon me

Much love from Mrs WÃ¶hrle, the blankets are finished and will be sent soon 
Martha Schmid was here, I think she grows in the Lord, till now no hope of a child, she is happy and loves her home though they have very little to live
