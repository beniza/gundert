 <Calw 2 Septbr 67>*
Dear Frederic

Thanks for your letter. It is gracious of the Lord to let you know and feel by having taken away peace, that it is a bitter thing to give ear to a second muster, who would like to make us slaves; so we learn to fight and hate self. If God would not keep us we would altogether have left Him long ago, but we have to learn to distrust our ownselves, our wisdom, and good understanding and prevoyance and learn to let us be guided as a child. Oh dear Frederic as a child how much have we to learn. Be always open telling us all that which troubels you, we can sympatise with you and pray for you I pray for a good time during the days Paul is there tell him every thing 
 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
