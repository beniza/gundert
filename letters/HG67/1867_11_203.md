 <20 November 67.>*
Dear Frederic

One of the shirts has been put on by papa a few hours, by mistake it came amongst papas shirts and so I without seeing gave it him, pardon It is soon cold enough to put on your flanell ones.

If the person who washes the socks in stutgart does not wash the woolen socks properly I shall then wash them here please let me know. 
A propos try to know what David would like for his Christmas! 
How is tante Anna? Give her my love and to your household.

I trust dear Frederic that God will spare you from becoming a soldier, He will I trust so incline the hearts that you may be made free. being unfit by your health meanwhile we look to God and wait upon Him, may He keep your mind in perfect peace
 Yours affectly J.G.
