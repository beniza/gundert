Dear children

Many thanks for your letter. Yes I feel that the Lord is with you and you learn to hear His voice, to do this we must cease to hear self and the world, The Lord lays much stress on hearing and repeated often let those who have ears to hear, hear! it is difficult and hard for us to listen to the voice of God, therefore He is often obliged to take the rod because we do not pay attention to His voice. I must confess that I am often ashamed when I consider how little I observe if one read Gods word, or hold a meeting. I trust you dear children will do better than your Mama. And the grand children? who are already so clever Julie who makes such questions and observations. I wish her opened ears to Gods voice inward and outward, I trust they will be thankful for the Christmas papa and mama give them and injoy it, When Frederic heard that I had no mind to make Goodle this Christmas, he approved heartily of it and promised to bring all his from Stutgart for Paul. I wish you a happy time and blessing in your congregation.

Adieu dear Children With kisses to you four
 yours J.G.
