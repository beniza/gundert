 Calw 3d May 1867
Dear Fredrich

It is a pretty long time since I wrote you. We had a little more to do than usual on account of cleaning and Mission feast. the whole went on well thank God, and I do not feel tired. Emelie Seger was here two days who did all with Jettle. We had about 80 peopel. Paul has already related you all about it I think, and he may tell you still more on tuesday when he comes to you. A propos Ask politely and with thankfulness Tante Anna whether she can recieve Paul. It is a kindness of her to recieve always every one of us in her house!

Give also please my love to Tante Emma, telling that I think much of her, and trust the Lord will soon make her well. I rejoice already till she comes to Calw to bathe. love to Mama, she will also come this summer to bathe! I wish you a good time dear son joyful as if it was our last day in this world, not sleeping, but watching for his coming.

 Adieu dear Fredric
 Yours J.G.
