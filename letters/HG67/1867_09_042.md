Dear Herman

Many thanks for your last letter A propos. when you know of an opportunity for America, let us know it please as I have just at work 12 shirts for you.

We had yesterday a lady from America her husband was pastor 5 years in St Louis he is consomptif has spent 8 weeks in Dinach and now will go to Italy. I did not like her much, it does not appear there is inward life in them. It is sad for any man to be with out a new life; but specially for a minister or missionnary.

We are getting railway in Calw, almost all our garden is taken for it, also 25 houses some still new or lately built. food is of course dearer from so many peopel living here. the streets are usually filled with strangers mostly Italieners.

I write you very little this time I am busy in doing a work which you understand well, and so did David that is heap wood for the winter, not every one can do it so that it remains firm,

Paul is just in Stutgart for the examen. afterward we go to Switzerland, D.V.

With love and kisses to your dear wife and children
 Yours affectly J.G
