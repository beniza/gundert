Dear Frederic

We were in Hirsau; but that weather was so hard that is the wind and rain; that we could scarsly keep our Umbrella, there were but few peopel, papa had the end of the 5th Chp in Matthew, specially on love and on the last verse be ye perfect as your father in Himmel is perfect. Since some time Louise is rather unwell so that we have been obliged to take a new servant. After some time Louise shall go DV to Nagold where Mrs Zeller will keep her during some time. the new one is from Sindelfingen a Louise Klein, she does not understand cooking so well as Louise; but I trust she will soon learn. 
One feareth that the Nagold will overflow this night it rains constantly. 
Give my love to all I pray. I was sorry not to have written to Mrs. Moerike in returning her box but I could not, tell her please when you see her 
Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
