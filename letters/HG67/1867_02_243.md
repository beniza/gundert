My dear Frederic.

Many thanks for your letter and for Marie's dress. it would not have been necessary, to send it so soon. many thanks also for the cravat which is very nice. Mrs. Postmeister tell no one from where she got the cloth. she does not even know from whom. Our account or debt by Unkel Adolph we do not pay we have an account together we shall settle it by and by. 
To day was the baptisem by Mr Steiger I should have been Godmother; but was glad that Jettle took this charge upon her I cannot. I am glad to hear that Mama is better I trust that the fever will not return. Give her please my best wishes and love, as well as to tante. Is tante Anna well? the next day we had been in Weiblingen she had a little diarrhea has she still? My love to her and all the house. I went to Mr. Wirz who showed me nice cloth which he advised you to take, he sent it to decatire I have not yet got it; but I trust you shall soon get it.

from David we have not had one line since we were in St Adieu dear F  Yours. J.G.
