My dear Frederic

I was glad to hear again from you your letters although small now and then give me always joy; tell me in your next how is D's cough, I heard from Martha Weitbrecht that it was not better, Papa himself on monday thought he had more cough than on sunday.

We have constant rain so that you feel the cold I suppose less than formerly. tell me please whether you have still stomackach and diarrhee? 
Are all the people well in your house? I trust you are happy in the Lord, and when, you feel unhappy think that it is some temptation which are to be overcome by faith and prayer, the Lord is the same unchangable; we change, but we must learn to abide in Him. We have all to fight and to overcome. Soon it will be over.

 Adieu my dear Frederic
 yours JG.
