Dear children

Your last letter has again rejoieced us, all what you say about your dear wife and children please us well. they must be a great joy to you. Julia reminds us of Marie when she was young, and I trust the Lord will make her his own property as He has made our Marie who gave us as a child a good deal of anxiety. Your Marie reminds us of our Christianele, she was the beloved of every one who knew her.

I trust your dear wife s hand will get cured, we are told to pray for our daily bread; this belongs to it, as soon as we understand our father's mind, and are obedient to the spirit, we realise the promise made to the peopel of Israel "I am thy phisician" willing to humbel ourselves, and give up all that which He points us out, as unfit for Him. He then shows that to Him et to faith all is possibel.

With much love and kisses to each of you Yours
 J.G.
