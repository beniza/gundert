Dear Frederic

It seems to me a very long time since we heard any thing of you. but tomorrow morning likely we shall hear how it went in Maulbro. We have just returned from Hirsau it was not so full as usual the text was the 17th Ch. our Lord s prayer specially on the words "keep them in thy name" and "I sancktify myself for them"

the letter of Herrman was again very nice, the Lord continues his work in him. We are a happy family, there <are>* few in the world in which all the children are the Lords as in our. great grace of God pure grace; may we be truly humble, and true witnesses to His glory. trying to bring some souls to Him.
