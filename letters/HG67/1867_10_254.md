Dear Frederic

Thanks for your letter recieved this morning. it would not have been needful to take the troubel to write to your tante. I had already thanked in your name.

I am glad to see by your letters that you occupy yourself with the word of God. it is the means to be preserved from many other unprofitabel thoughts and to grow in knowlege and grace, may God give you more and more thirst after the bread of life so that you be fed thereby to praise our Lord. 
Give my love to your household. how is tante Anna?

 Adieu dear son
 Yours J.G.
