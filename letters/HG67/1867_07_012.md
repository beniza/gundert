Dear Frederic

Your letter has just come for which many thanks. be not discouraged it is the way we have all to go, and Peter says 1 P 4,12. also first and second verses, when we suffer on account of our mistakes sins, we are gradually made free from them. it does not leave us so quick, we have long to morn to sigh over it, and often feel as if we had no wish any longer to fight. the people of Israel could not at once destroy their enemies, in order that the wild beasts did not kill them; it is so with us through fighting against sin we are kept humble, and dependent upon the Lord, distrusting ourselves more and more, the wild beasts, pride, would soon take possession of us, if not kept down by the knowlege of this wicked self, and we have not yet fought against sin till blood Heb 12,4. these word have occupied me much these days. "striving against sin unto blood". So pray, so resist sin, that in prayer we feel something of that which the Lord felt wenn he prayed in the Garden in Getzemane, Oh dear Son be of good chear, you shall get the victory. remember how much He has already helped, thank and praise Him. then the roaring Lion will flee away, try to rejoice in the Lord through faith, in Him we are more than Conquerors. faith is our weapon. read much Gods word We pray together
 yours J.G.
