My dear Frederic

Many thanks for your good letter. I am very glad that you tell me your feelings about the M. <Mück>* in your house. It is for you a school. if you have grace to overcome yourself in this matter you will get great blessings Perhaps I would feel something like you about the M. <(Mück)>* but as we know that they are children of God we must overcome ourselves and well consider the words of John who says, if we do not love the brethern we are in darkness. love to the brethren whomsoever they may be and however they may be, is the chief mark of our having passed from death to life. Some it is difficult to love it is quite true, I feel it too. but the Lord loves us however bad and desagreable we are; therefore we must love all the children of God; lately I have thought more about it as I was reading the Epistel of John, read it too I pray you specialy the 3d Chap. May God give you rich blessings. Jea my dear Son pray for love, that you may not have to repent afterward like your poor mother about Marie,

You may give to papa a cravat like the one you gave me once for Dekinger, or you may give him a silk pocket heankerchief, foular, these two things are well come by him but buy only one between you both David and you. 
Now my dear Son once more I thank you to write me all about yourself. may the Lord give you the victory

 Adieu yours
 J.G.
