Dear Frederic

Have you no flanell shirt to wash, please bring it when you come that one may wash it. how is it with the socks do you pay every time. I do not wish that Grandmama has any trouble about them; but I shall hear all when you come, bring also the dirty things you may have now in Stutgart Clean ones you shall find here.

Papa had the mission Stunde here to day, he spoke first on the words of the Lord to the discipels! You are the light of the world, the Lord told it them before they were advenced in faith just in the begining of their carrier, every christian should ask himself. Am I light to those who suround me? after that he related or translated from English about missions work in India. specially during the famine, while 1 and half <1 1/2>* a million heathen died not a Christian died of hunger.

I shall be very glad to see you soon give my love to Tante A. C. to Hochstrasse etc
 Yours J.G.

Bring your socks which are to be mended
