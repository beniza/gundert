Dear Frederic

I thank you for your letter, be not discouraged come again to the Lord who is an advocate for us before the father. learn through these repeated sins to distrust yourself and rely more and more on your Lord who will be asked continually; perhaps you have been lazy in prayer, then the devil took advantage of it to tempt you. We must often repeat the words of the Lords prayer "lead us not into temptation" the devil watches every moment, how he might make us to fall, therefore our Lord who knew it said "watch and pray, that ye may not fall in temptation" It is right you tell us how it stands with you, it is written "Confess your faults to one another" it is the way to get pardon, and the devil flys from us. read James 5,16 thats the way to be healed, cured, made free.

Dearest Frederic may God keep you bless you, and give you the victory. Unser Glaube ist der Sieg, der die Welt, Teufel, s√ºnde selbst uberwindet. Adieu dear Son
 yours JG
