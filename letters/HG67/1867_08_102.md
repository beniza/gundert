Dear Frederic

The box with the clothes has arrived for which many thanks. Have you paid the Merredig? send us once the account of the two dresses please that we may know how much they cost. Did you ask Tante Anna, if she can loge me one or two nights? So you had a good sunday at Buch; but you were I fear some what excited, "aufgeregt"

Morix Gakenheimer gives a goodeal of troubel to his parents, he is very impatient, tells even that he will shoot himself, if he must be always ill, I meet him some time on the street; he does not look so ill as he did. 
Adieu dear Frederic
 love to all in your house
 yours J.G.
