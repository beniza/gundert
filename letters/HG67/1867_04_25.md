 Calw 25th April 67
Dear Frederic

Thanks for your letter God be praised for his goodness to you. I am glad you will visit my friend Moritz Gakenheimer; I have visited him often when he was ill; he had fears about dying; he has read your Pilgers progress, and many other good books; but he is very weak and timide; minds the world too much, his parents will be very glad if you can get him in good companies; may God give you grace for him and turn his heart to the Lord. At home he gave good deal of trouble by his impatience and ill humourd; he was most of the time cross and querelling with them all. His parents are wordly peopel; but still not without knowledge, the grand father died I hear as a believer and it made some impression on them specially on Moritz. Be of good cheer though it should not succeed with him continue to seek to bring souls to Jesus.

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
