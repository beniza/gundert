My dear Frederic

What shall I wish you, for your birthday. you know it yes, a mind to follow the Lord fully. grace to fight and overcome. Oh it is some thing precious to know and experience that we fight not in vain, as Paul says we beat not the air, no, we take the armour or weapons discribed us in Gods word. Ephesians 6,10 til 18, The 16th vers I had to think more about the last days Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. the fiery darts, it is some time fearful when God allows the devil to try us it is really fiery darts, from the ruler of darkness of this world.

wiles of the devil, spiritual wickedness in high place. May God dear Frederic give you grace to abide in the Son, in Jesus, He helps and protects us. 
I send you no goodly as I have seen that you do not care for them, you are also a man now! I trust David has bought for you a carpet bag which pleases you. On friday you shall get your stockings and the new trawsers which are finished. Wishing you peace and joy
 Yours J.G.
