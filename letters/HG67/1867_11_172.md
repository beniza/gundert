Dear Frederic

Though I have nothing to say. I will tell you a good night; my peopel are in the Stunde and I will soon go to bed. We have all gone to Hirsau, where God gave us a good word, about the 21rst of John. on the words of the Lord to Peter lovest thou me? and follow thou me, these words are still addressed to us daily. could we but hear them. If we love really, we know also that we can feed his lambs at least some one or other, we must carefully follow than it will be clear to us how to feed the lambs or in other words serve, in words and deeds. I trust the Lord gives you grace to transport the mountains which often stand before you as before me, through faith alone can we remouve them! Sometime early the morning stands already such a mountain, faith must act and remove it. Mai God give you grace for it 
Adieu dear Son. Yours J.G.
