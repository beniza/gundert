My dear Frederic

We heard the Lord has taken to himself the baby; He helps the parents to take it well from his hand I trust. How are you dear Son, have you peace in the Lord? you have not told me whether you are quite well now; you will soon get again your old room I suppose. I am very glad to hear that you like your flanell shirts, I think they are healthy for you. How is grandmama, the death of the baby will have affected her. give her please my special love,

Emanuel Gross is some what better; still at home by his parents. We have plenty snow, the children can use their sledges one hears them till 9 and 10 O'clock when other propre children sleep.

Now adieu dear Sonele
 yours JG.
