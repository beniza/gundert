Dear Frederic

I hope that you have a good day for your birthday; I send you here with, your trawsers and socks, other things you need not till we wash again. 
8th your letter has just come for which many thanks. I am glad that you had a good day and that you were pleased with your presents. We must value our father's present of his dear Son much more than all others in the world. and His gifts should stand daily fresh and new before us like on our birthday, thenn, love will grow within us. How much should we thank and praise for the unspeakable gift of Eternal life which we have in the Son. 
Give my love and thanks to your dear people
 Yours J. Gundert
