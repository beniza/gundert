Dear Frederic

Again sunday evening, again a nice meeting in Hirsau. I wished you could have been there and injoyed the meditation on the words of the Lord to his discipels, you are the salt of the earth, the light of the world. In the Lord alone we can be such; by ourselves alone we are darkness. We should every day examine ourselves whether we are truly salt and light. 
Emelie was not in Hirsau and Jettle relates her about the meeting; could I relate you as she does I could fill many pages and could thereby be much edified; but I have no talent for it. If you only keep in mind that in abiding in the Lord you are salt and light, it will do - the other will the Lord teach you Himself. We are happy peopel to be abel to feed on the word of life; if I had but that which I remember of a meeting or preaching I would be starving. God be praised for the fountain He gives us in which we can drow continually.

With a hearty kiss to you and love to all our dear peopel, specially to Tante Anna I remain
 yours J.G.
