 <14 Juni 1867>*
My dear Frederic

Many thanks for your note, and for the troubel you took about the soap. I am glad to have two pounds of the one you bought; I do not want common one; I would have taken it only if you could not have had your monney back without buying some thing for that value. now it is allright, I want nothing more, the one you have you shall send me with your wash afterward. David will have told you that I wait for Paul to go to Schweiz in September. During papa's absence already before Louise goes to see her mother. I shall then if it is fine weather pass my days in the wood, in schaaf Weg or pietiste weg! You would like to have such a good day no? Our Friend Knorr looks very happy and free since he has passed the examen, I hope that thereby his faith has been encreased. I wish you peace and joie  Yours J.G.
