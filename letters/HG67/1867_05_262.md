Dear Frederic

You see that the Lord is the same and very gracious to you. Is it not that by confessing our Lord, in seeking souls to bring them to Him, we are thereby revived and quickned ourselves. We are also more on our guard; that our life be according to our words, We are very thankful to God who gives you a good time, the present experience are for you a token how one can be with the Lord, how bold we can be in prayer and supplication. and in confessing the Lord there are more occasions to prayer, for us and for those to whom we speak or have spoken,

May God fill your heart with love through the knowlege of his unspeakable love this alone can enable us to do some thing to his Glory. I am glad to hear that tante Anna is better, give her my love, tante Emma comes soon I hear, I am glad of it. I am sorry that you are to get some troubel with the things which Tusnelde hat gekauft fur Marie; but we cannot manage other wise.

Adieu dear Son
 Yours JG.
