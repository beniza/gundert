 Calw 7th April 67
Dear Frederic

Probably papa will ask tomorrow whether I have a line for the sons in Stutgart So in order to have a sign of life and love I write this already to day while the people are in the Stunde by Muller. We were rather few people to day in Hirsau; but we had a very good word, on John 15th about abiding in the Lord in order to bring fruits, and about cutting the branches which bear no fruit and purging those which bear fruit in order that they may bring more fruit. We know what it means to purge, we do not like it always; but the Lord does not ask us, He makes his work, God be praised for his faithfulness towards us,

Do you not know as yet whether you will be allowed to come one or two days during Paul s stay here?

Do you know anything of Mrs. Isenberg, is she well?

 Love to all
 Yours J.G.

P.S. Your letter has just come for which many thanks. had you anything to pay for your box? Steiger puts on the old trawsers and west you sent me things from you or papa he puts on things, however old they may be and with great joy but not so from other peopel.
