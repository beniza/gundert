Dear Frederic

I am much with you in thoughts you three in Maulbroon and I trust our Lord gave you a good day together. I would have liked to see and hear you together. I hope you will relate us much of your trip to M.

Do you know nothing of tante Emma? when does she comes to Calw we expect her every day. it is now so good weather she should soon come Do tell her please with my love to come soon.

Your letters give us joy. the Lord be praised for His great love to you. 
Adieu dear Son.
 Yours JG.

P.S. Would you be so kind and lent your papa, your small cofer or port manteau to go to Bale, as I intend DV to go a few days before him to Corcelles I would take his bag and he would have yours, we shall take great care of it. Give it please to Da he can bring it next Saturday, buy also for me please a pound of soap as you did last year. Get also my cap I have still with Mrs Isenberg and put it carefully in your portmanteau so that it does not spoil
