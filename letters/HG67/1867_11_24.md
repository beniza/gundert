Dear Frederic

Every monday morning I am looking out for a letter from you from David we have rather seldom; as he has much to do; I am glad that we shall D.V. soon see each other. If you were not to come altogether at Christmas I would have made up my mind and go to Stutt. to see you; but the time is now so short that I of course wait to see you here, which is also better, It is very cold here, how is it with you? is your bed warm enough? If you want a blanket tell me, I would send you the one of the Gastzimmer and you would bring it at Christmas and take it back again. have you any stomak ache? I your feet are cold in day time put on two pairs of socks;

I do not intend to make goodly you get in Stutgart as well as David and you do not care much for them.

We hear nothing from our dear peopel there in Hoch and Olga Stra√üe. Give them my love. I hope that you had a good day to day, and found food for your soul in Gods word. Where hunger and thirst is, God lets us not go empty Adieu my dear son
 Yours J.G.

Please buy for me 2 two pounds of Chocolat, of the same as you have sent me before. I shall pay it you with the Meredig it is for Ancle Christmas present
