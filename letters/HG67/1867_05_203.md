Dear Frederic

A few lines only to thank for your letter, Jes dear Son in overcoming ourselves, we get faith and courage, for He who has helped once will help farther. it is his will, that we learn to trust Him and thereby He is glorified through his repeated help. Oh we are happy peopel to belong to such Lord.

Tell dear tante Anna that I would have invited Tante Caroline to come with her but we have no room for the brethren W. and when tante Emma come which I trust she will soon do, she shall be with Anna in one room. 
Tell her I do hope she will come. If tante Caroline does not mind sleeping in an other house and be the whole day with us I shall be very glad that she comes, and her brothers too, do tell her one of the brother might be with Kittel and one with Emanuel and Caroline with Emelie Seger or Weitbrecht. be sure you give her my hearty love and tell her, so long as Hebich is not in Stutgart it woud be the right time

Adieu dear Son
 Yours JG
