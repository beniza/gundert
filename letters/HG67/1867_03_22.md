Dear Frederic

I was glad to hear again from you. I fancy that you are not pleased with your new set of Clothes. perhaps the cloth itself is not according to your taste; but Mr Wirz chose it for you and he understands it better than me, or did he just want to sell that piece? another time one must send you the patterns.

I thank the Lord that you continue to be happy in the Lord, although there are now and then dark and difficult moments. and it is good we learn to distrust self, and look to the Lord who likes to give us grace for grace. It is nice you paid a visit to Mr Hebich, one has usually profit of such visits.

Do you see Jettle offen we hear nothing from her. Give her my love, as well as to our other friends

 Adieu yours J.G.
