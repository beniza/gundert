My dear Children

As I hear that you get a good deal of news already I send you but a few lines, Your last letter has given me much joy, specially the one to your old friend Mr Mo So the Lord gradually brings you to faith alone! the Lord be praised for this unspeakable grace. Mrs Zeller in Nagold where we were lately was much pleased to hear news about the old friend of her nevew Merle. His conversion has of course caused her much joy.

Your account of last year shows what an excellente house mother you have, beside two children continually visitors and so little expenses; that testifies in her favour and praise certainly. Dear Christine I wish I could send a petticoat as she wished to have one for Xmas! Grosspapa and Grossmama would certainly have rejoiced to see their two granddaughters admiring the beautiful tree which had been prepared for them. We shall be very glad to get a Ph* of Mariele when one can get it Julius stands very near me, with Ernst's children. We have also Marie's boy, we are already rich in grandchildren, without having the joy to see one of them; I hope that dear Christine with the dear pets and yourself are well.

 With a kiss your J.G.
