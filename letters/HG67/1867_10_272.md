 Calw Sunday <27 Oct 67>1
Dear Frederic

Today we were in Hirsau, as usual God gave us a good word about the resurection of the Lord and faith in Him. it was pretty full. though two bretheren alone were there. We shall soon lose our Emely <Müller>* it seems, I am sorry for it, we like her much; but the Inspector wishes her in Bale as teacher in Kinderhouse; You know perhaps more of it than I do. we expect her mother tomorrow. Have you heard of Paul since he is in Tubingen? I have still heimweh after him, perhaps more so because he had not been well. I must learn to believe for him. God will care for body, soul and spirit. but I feel the need to repeat often the words of our Lords prayer. "lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil" The devil trys by all means to hurt us, in some way or other, and comes still as an engel of light to tempt us, therefore the Lord has said watch and pray that ye fall not. How is Eyman does he hear Hebich? give him my love as well as to all other friends
 Yours in love J.G.
