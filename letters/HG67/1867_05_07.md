Dear children

Many thanks for your last I was very glad to hear that Christina's hand is some what better; we must trust the Lord who has not told us in vain to bring all our cares before Him, we feel and experience that indeed He cares for us, and that all his promises are yea and amen to those who believe, that the key to have them fulfilled in us is faith; for it is said to him that believeth are all things possible! we are happy people, as soon as we have learnt to distrust ourselves; we realise that the Lord works in us, the will and the doing. Our Paul has been with us nearly three weeks, one has a real joy to see and hear him. He goes to morrow to Stutgart I am going with him the morning early and come back the same evening; tante Emma ist not well already since some time. I wish to see her; she has boils or abscesses under the arms, the Dr sais that it will be a long business! at first one thought it might be dangerous; but now it does not seam so, 
I hope my two grand daughters will be pleased with the little dresses ihr grandmama has made them. I take with me to Stutgart your fotograph for our dear peopel to look at; I regret that the person through whom you have sent it could not come to us, it would have been such joy to hear about yourselves and for you to hear of us; now dear children we are often with you in thoughts and send a tender kiss to every one of you
 yours J.G.
