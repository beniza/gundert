Dear Frederic

On saterday 30 do not forget to send your wash with David, send also your underhosen, and all what you have, it is a long time since you have sent your flanell do you put it on still?

Jettle brought us good news of you all. Soon we shall see each other again. I trust With love
 yours J.G.

Did you no more see a white adress on the box which came from Maulbron has it been so torn away? I am very sorry that it came; but it had the same adress as before to Olgastr. and you got it safe several times.
