 Calw 29th June 1867
Dear papa

It is a pity one did not go to the post yesterday evening, you might have had this letter of Samuel before leaving Calw. there was one from Elisabeth to her mother, and one to Eugenie Dreis. We are just returning from Church where we have heard helfer rather good preaching, better than any one I have hither to heard.

After dinnar we are going to Liebenzel; as it is not raining and pleasant to walk. May God give you a good time in Bale, love to all those who remember me.
 Yours J.G.
