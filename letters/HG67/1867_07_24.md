Dear Frederic

I send you herewith 2 more towels so that you may change more often. I did not know that you had so few. It seems to me a long time since I wrote you. I speak often of you with Tante who gives you a good witness, and I believe God gives you also a good one, As soon as we learn to distrust ourselves and look on Him who alone can help, God is pleased with us, he dowelth with those who are of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. the feeling that we can do nothing right works in us a broken heart.

I know that it is your conviction. Oh dear Frederic it is a fearful thing to be proud and hauty, we are all by nature, grace alone can make us humbel, if we consider a little the words God resisteth the proud, but is gracious to the humbel, we will surely pray for true humility. The devil trys to catch us by different means but with Gods grace we are preserved. Adieu dear Son.
 Yours J.G.
