 <30 August 67>*
Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your two letters, I had not much time till now, Papa came back for noon unexpected; but we were all delighted to see him and hear so many nice anecdotes. You shall hear him once too.

I send herewith your trawsers and socks, We shall not wash before I return from Corcelles; if you should want any thing give them to Grossmama or tante who will kindly have them washed for you; but you must pay for them 
I hope that you are fighting the good fight and get the victory over flesh and blood I am glad that you had a letter from Paul which did help and rivive you.

 Adieu dear Son
 Yours JG
