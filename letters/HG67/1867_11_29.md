Dear children <Marie>*

On dear Charles birthday I trust our Lord has restored you again and given you a good day together in Hydrabad. It seems that Elisabeth is also not strong Emma Plebst writes that she looks weak and delicat; but such constitutions bear often afterward the climat better than other, I hope it will be so with you three. The cool season is now near: during which you may with Gods grace recover new strength, and so dear Marie for the time of need.

To day poor Weisser in klein Wildbad has been burried, he drunk to much as he used to do some time and fell in the Nagold Monday evening on his return from Liebenzel; the whole Wagner regrette that he died in that way; but are glad to be ridd of him.

Mrs. BÃ¤tzner is often very poorly, she sees very little and only of one eye, the other has gradually lost all sight and one fear that she will soon be compleatly blind.

I am glad you are to get your old Dr avoied specially being nervous and anxious. I am sorry for you that there are no news about Margaret; perhaps she got an offer just at the time, however the Lord will provide for you I trust sending you help. I trust He makes surely all right, for you and for Margaret. We can but pray for you.

With a hearty kiss to you three
 Yours J.G.
