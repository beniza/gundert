 Calw 31 March 1867
My dear Frederic

I hope you have a good day to day Lords day, I imagine that we have been already some days without news from you; but perhaps in your wash Küsthen is a note, it comes only tomorrow morning. Today we were in Hirsau, we had snow and strong wind on the way. papa spoke on the words in John I will send you another comforter or advocate,

What is doing poor Ludwig has he no place as yet?

Mr Kittle has gone to Nagold for the ordination of Lodholz who is going to Africa, some other yung men from here have gone too.

Zahn is not well since some time, he suffers from the chest; I know nothing of the Wirtzes but I think they are well

I hope you are well
 With love yours J.G.
