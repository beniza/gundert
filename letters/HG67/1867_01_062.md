 <6 Januar 67>*
1My dear Frederic

You have your papa with you and I hope you get some blessing. the letters from Indian will have given you joy, the photograf of Theodor <geb 1866>* is really very nice; but Marie looks very thin and poorly. Samuel looks also different from what he did, some what older, Elisabeth looks very happy. I had a small note from her, no news;
I hope you are quite well, Do you still feel the cold so much as formerly? Did you also thank Mrs Isenberg for the cravat you got? and David? Does not your flanell shirt want to be washed? you might send it me by David in a paquet!
