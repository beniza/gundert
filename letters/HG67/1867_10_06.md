 Calw 6th October 67
Dear Frederic

It is already four weeks since I wrote you last. I could not do it as long as we were in Switserland, and since our return I found so much to do that I could not write, your box was paid? you did not take amiss what Jettle wrote about giving your socks to Mama to be washed, she told me she would care for them; but you must pay please. <give them every week or as mama tells you> I shall give you the money gladly for every pair, but do not forget to send me through David those which are torn for I do not wish that Mama be troubeld in mending them, nor pay for them!

Your shirts shall be made according to your desire I would have come gladly to Stutgart; but have no time I must prepare Pauls things I am glad and thank you for trying to do good to Eyman, his father is very thankful for the love shown to his son.

Adieu dear son yours J.G.
