My dear wife

It is somewhat difficult here to write to you but as it must be done I shall tell you shortly that all went well, though indeed in changing carriages before Mayence I lost (forgot) my hat and had to buy one of an other sort at Mainz. In the evening was met by Theodor and found the Apostle Paul, a Hotel where aunt Emma had been once. Theod accompanied me on Saturday, we saw Johanna, second Theodor and the girls at Dusseldorf and reached this safely about 6 PM. I am with a very dear Man, Mr J.J. Bredius, who has other German's in his house Everything very grand and comfortable, hardly any time left - Gess is with me just now, Theod in a hotel Kaiserskrone, but invited to dine with us. One dines at 5 or 6 usually, and then it will never come to an end. Great sufferings are thus entailed on a man who would like to be up and doing, we become gradually Dutchmen and care for the flesh better than in the blackforst.

Farewell now and may the Lord bless you all

 Greetings to all
 Yours in Christ
 H.G.
