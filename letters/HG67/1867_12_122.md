Dear Frederic

Tomorrow I shall have no time to write you so a few lines this evening. To day I have got our koaks so had to look after the women who carry it, Louise is not at all well, we have some body to do her work. after Christmas she shall go for some monthes to Nagold where Mrs. Zeller will kindly recieve her; I send back Mrs. Moerikes box please to send it her or David with many thanks. The time is soon there that we shall be together may God give us some blessings with the joy we expect to have.

 Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
