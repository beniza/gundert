 <24 April 67.>*
Dear Frederic

Du bist so troken und leer, and I am also such a one, but we will encourage each other to draw from the well from the fountain of life. We must repeatedly feel that in us is no life, the father and the Son have life in them selves, but we have it, in abiding in them, some time we find it hard to draw so constantly; to day for instance I am very tired from our trip to Altstaig. it is far and the road bad we were four hours going and so much returning, it was nice, the church full Kees, papa, and KÃ¼nsler were the chief speakers,

Poor papa has a hard day to day, went early to Phorz. did not know how he would go farther, per post or what. will come back D.V. this evening to Calmbach and tomorrow here, He will of course write before he goes to Bale. 
David will tell you all about the schawl of C.W. which is in Stutg. 
Love from all here, my love to your household. Let us look to Jesus Adieu dear F
 yours J.G.
