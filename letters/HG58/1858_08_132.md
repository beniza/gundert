My dear Marie

Mrs Whiteh. asked kindly after you as did also Miss van Someren at Ooty. You see you have already friends in parts which you have not yet seen. 
You will know that the So. Mahratta Stations had been exposed to great peril by the revolt of some chieftains and wicked Brahmins, but all is quiet again. It seems that Leonberger was in the very centre of the revolt shortly before the outbreak and the Rajah who is now hanged was particularly hospitable to him (as if wishing to disarm all suspicion).

You may be sure that preaching will be done carefully and cautiously, and only real love, not expressed merely, but also felt and tangible, can make it tolerable to some ears. The boldness of testifying is a gift and lies less within the sphere of the young and of women in general, but the love of Christ teaching and constraining us we may find ways to preach even without words as Peter has it. It is not that I find fault with your freedom to Miss Caemerer, for I think she may consider herself well as your schoolfellow and herself not so immensely superior. But with older persons you must be careful, pray first, and try to realise that they may have much which you never discovered in them, and then begin to speak with respect and love. To kings one can never preach Christ (says Boos) except by being brought before them for judgment Love finds a way.
 Your Papa
