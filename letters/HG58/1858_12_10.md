My dear wife

Thanks for your letter - it arrived this morning, I hope you have ventured once more to write as the post seems to go regularly enough and I may be here till Monday night if not longer. Yesterday evening I saw Taylor running along the sea shore and measuring a line of a mile. He came afterwards to the Whiteh. for tea, and we had an immense party, some 10 or 15 people, a little singing - with tea and cakes a psalm read, after which I had to pray, then a glass of wine and farewell. I did not go asleep till after midnight, so very wonderful was the thing - or rather as I had slept in the afternoon I did not soon find sleep in the night. Talked a little with Mirus the Hamburg merchant, who married that Coonoor lady, he now comes somewhat nearer, than before, goes to Church etc. - Kleinknecht I hear had tetanus (lockjaw, Hundskrampf) his life was saved with difficulty, when he is a little stronger, the hand will still have to be amputated they say. - Rama is well and does all. You may ask the writer if he wants any money and give him 5 in advance. -

Mrs Leslie keeps abed it seems, also he does not go out but I saw the Cullins, d'Albedhyll's, A. Lawson, Capt. Shaw etc. At Quilon I may go to see Col Congdon if I like or find time. Little news here, nobody offers anything interesting - all have their own business. I keep much to my room  Your HG
