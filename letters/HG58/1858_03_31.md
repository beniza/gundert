 Cochin 31 March 1858.
My dear Sir!

I think it my duty to apprise you without delay, though by an other hand, of a resolution I have formed after reviewing my years connection with the Government service.

I set out on my task with a considerable amount of strength and courage, throwing myself, as I thought, heart and soul into the work before me; however that may have been I feel that a change has taken place. After some premonitory warnings I have during the last 2 months struggled with complaints new to me, under which I lost my sense of comfort in my peculiar work, and, now I have been prostrated with a severe attack of dysentry, of which Dr Leslie has informed you. Under these circumstances I conceive that I overrated my strength when I entered, after so many years spent in India upon this new employment. I feel therefore bound to request you to resume the charge you have honoured me with at your earliest convenience. I hope in the course of next week to return to Calicut where I may commence preparations for making over my office to my successor.

I remain my dear Sir
 yours truly
