Dear Papa

Yesterday I was glad to get yours from Kodakal and see how the Lord had brought you so far. You will have had good deal of rain the remaining part of the journey. to day is very nice; but you are at home I trust. 
You will have received many letters though none from our children. 
Convert is well again. As we are to have the Lord supper next sunday Fritz cannot go to Kodakal this week. Marie nice and diligent in learning I think. she has toothach! How is Stroble? it is good you can help him to put in order Paul his servant for the begining. As M will write too I say good bye
 Yours J.G.



1My very dear Papa,

just a little good morning salutation. We were glad to hear from you and that it went so. So Mrs Deggeler has a little prince! May your voyage go on nicely under His good Guardianship.

 With a kiss
 your child Mary.
