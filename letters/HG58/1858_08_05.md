Mrs Gundert, Calicut

 Coonoor 5 Aug <58>*
My dear wife

Copybooks shall be sent with the next opportunity of written papers. 
Plebst and Moer came in yesterday from Kotergiri, the former intends soon to go down to Bang. Hoch may accompany him, but they will certainly be a month longer on the hills than I. Miss Hale is certainly a nice Christian, whom all esteem. Mrs van Someren lives with her and they seem to be earnest together and devoted to the young of the joint family. Who is the Peper1 who had to sit outside Calicut Church?

Mrs Mgl's letter you might return once with other papers, I mean that about Mgl's separation from Basle. It may interest here the Kaity brethren. All are sorry for this step. Of course nothing else could be expected if Mgl did not even take the trouble of going to Basle to hear what they may have against him. Herm. describes him very well. I dare say he will have proceeded to thouing before many minutes.

Yesterday so many came to the meeting that our chairs would not suffice and Boswell's had to sit on my Sopha in the next room, Moer and Plebst having only a bed to sit on.

There are rumors that the Governor <Harris>* seems incurable. Dr Sanderson has been cited up for him. Major Minchin has written that Casamajor's Westindian (Antigua) mortgage is apparently irrecoverable. Now farewell and may the Lord give you all joy and peace
 Your HG.
