 Coonoor 10 July <58>*
My dear wife

This morning I sent to you a view of Coonoor Church. The zink covered house of the old General Kennett is to the left of it. The house or cottage to the right is ours, but it has 3 and not 2 chimneys; and in one of them blazes now and then a fine fire of dry rosesticks, cut during the day and kindled in the evening to the amusement of the children. - I saw Mrs Robinson on Friday She was not very communicative, perhaps I came just in a wrong moment. Today the Hochs have also gone there. I doubt if she will come tomorrow for our service, as she seems in a hurry to go on to Ooty. - Of course give the arrowroot to the Leslies as from us. For this month you will get from me only 35 Rs, but afterwards more will come. We must just manage as we best can since I have become so great as even to purchase a house. I have no time to write to Marie. Mrs Hoch thanks her for her kind recollection. She and the children are well, but not very strong. 
You will like Gompertz's letter. Foord's is poor. If I have sent the last time a letter of Diez it was by mistake and I wish it back as I have not yet answered it. I trust you are well in body and feel happy under the care of our heavenly shepherd who knows and seasonably supplies all our wants. Christian regards to the Hodges and love to Marie. Greet also the brethren  Ever yours HG.
