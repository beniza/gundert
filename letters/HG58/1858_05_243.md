My dear Marie

Shall I also once point out mistakes? on Papa = own Papa. lignes = lines. Mrs Bean never gave me her loves. This is quite out of order from a lady to a Gentleman. She gave me regards and that sort of thing. Christians send each other love (Singular). perheaps = perhaps (from hap Glück, daher happy). merchand = merchant. "To yesterday was Pentecost." Hat es sich bis auf gestern erstreckt? oder heißt es So? Wahrscheinlich to small as = too small than that God should think of it. damb = damp daher unser dämpfig. Soviel im letzten die früheren mag ich nicht nachsehen, sonst ärgert Dich der Brief troz des excellenten Papiers.

The Addis speak often of their Alice, who died of consumption about one year ago in a heavenly frame of mind. That is what we will be ready for, to go out of this poor world at a moment's notice and have nothing to regret, because blood and Spirit have done their work and taken away all sting of sin. But these are transactions that are brought about by strange workings and hard struggles. Well - all in its time. You will also one day be drawn into it and learn a little to understand Gethsemane.

 With best love
 your Papa
