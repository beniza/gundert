My dear Marie

Today 5th your letters for home. I will send them by Bombay (8th). But I think you ought to write home with a finer pen, else they have trouble to read them. - Why should Ostertag be offended? have you not got your letter? I return it by Fritz or Mama he suffers in the eyes. - You will learn by and by to take things more quietly - rejoice over letters when you get them, bear it somehow, if they will not come. I know it from myself that this habit grows but slowly, nevertheless it comes, in the same measure as God's message to our hearts becomes daily fresher and more refreshing to us. - How is Adele with you? and can you also play Mama with her when she has fever or is out of sorts? I hope you speak freely with Harriet H. It is the first occasion of the kind: to one near you in years not too old not too young, so there is no excuse. Noone is a hero to his valet, says the french proverb: and it is difficult to be a Christian to those next to us and most conversant with our frailties

Now you have an opportunity So let me hear how you do acquit yourself - but beware of (spiritual?) vanity

 In the Lord
 your father
