 <c. 11 Januar 58>*

It is Sunday night (10 Jan) - We looked at a Pattimar at some distance about 2 PM when Mrs Degg. came up and wanted to speak to me about going to Europe. We had just done when a servant came and said the party has landed - I walked down from big Balmatha and met the Bührer's bandy halfway down the hill - heard already a deep voice "Ach das ist mein Vater" and there was Mary with the Hauffs. I shook hands but she drew me nigh and nearly choked me with embracing and kissing - I had to beg her not pull me too much to the wheel. Well so we met - spent the afternoon at Balm. took tea at the Degg's and then I left her for the night: Talked with the Hauffs, who had been very faithful. Mary but giddy the poor Mr B. importune and stupid in trying to entice her. If possible I leave on Tuesday morning - but as the Cabinboat I came with is not quite ready it might be Wednesday morning before I leave, and then you might look for me about Thursday evening or Friday morning. That's enough for the present

Therefore good by
 Your HG

1My dear Pfleiderer

Following your good example I will not hesitate but report to you that the Kallerbusc with Mssrs. Hauff and Co have just come in. They will probably leave tomorrow evening, leaving Miss Hornberger here with Mr Müller. 
 Yours sincerely
