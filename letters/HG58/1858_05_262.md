Dear Papa

Thanks for yours of the 23d which also came yesterday some come so quickly that it is quite a joy.

Rama has received on his salary 4 Rs ad. The horsekeeper 3 Rs. the Grasscutter came I have paid him he told me of the 3 ans.

Rama had in his hand 5 Rs and one givend advance to the Coolies makes 6 Rs. on your account. We have had 3 fine days; but today again much rain! We paid our visit to the Cooks she did not know you had left this nor that you were ill; but she has ears only for her own things. Mrs Rob and baby well. Mr Grant is the best friend of Bean so I suppose the piety is coresponding too. Fritz forgot that he had mentioned me to send you his last letter! 
 With love Yours J.G.
