 Coimb 27 May 58

My dear wife

I had a very good day, bright and cheerful, little of the symptoms of disease, but I still keep nearly the whole time on the couch. Today we have been seeking for pome granates (apples) and although none was to be had on the bazar, the horsekeeper got one from a butler. Half of it is to be eaten one day, half the other. I have also some faith in its doing good. I use my medecines (new ones) in greater quantities, and the stools diminish proportionally. - The Addis' have heard of their son, his health seems to improve, which is a great comfort to me - just now your letters arrive (6 PM) I mean your own and Marie's with that of Mrs Stanger, Mglg etc I am sorry for the Stangers but know not what to write. To recommend them to Glasson or any one (Fitzgibbon might be better as being on Canarese ground) is a hazardous undertaking. Perhaps I best tell them to enquire at Mangalore about Canarese Coffee plantations. There is such a selfdelusion in all they think about their continual squabbles that I fear God will yet lead them thro' hard ways. - Your Basle letter has not arrived. I especially miss returns from Alattoor which now must have been nearly 20 days on the road to Calicut and have detained my report on the Malab. Schools already a fortnight has nothing written been put into the paper bundle? - Give Marie my love I must conclude for this day there being work

 Goodbye
 Yours HG
