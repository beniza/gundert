My dear Marie

I should have had no objection to your partaking of the Lord's supper if indeed you had hunger and thirst for it. For this is the only condition that God makes - and lest there be a childish desire to join in what the old people are doing, it is expressed in the words Let a man examine himself. If you can examine yourself (which a child cannot - and an unawakened person will not do) you can also distinguish if your desire be of the right kind: and then nobody can hinder you. But I am also quite content if you wait until my return for your emancipation from the outer Court and the admission to full Church communion. - The expression "it does one always good" is something very dubious. always, if you have hunger after righteousness, which is Jesus - but not at all if you cannot or will not examine yourself. It does many people great harm to think that now they have again settled their score for a month or year, and are quit with God. It would be much better if they tried to repent and believe, instead of pressing themselves forward into the privileges of true believers

But now farewell Can you read the rest?
 Your Papa
