My dear Marie

The Whitehouse will now soon come up when I hear of your friend, the addresser of the pig, I shall try to send you a notice about his welfare. - It is right that you feel a little excited by Gompertz's letter, for he is one in a 1000, and many a Church or little Congregation has none like him. but this must be said in private, as no man can swallow and digest praise readily. I am sure the Lord is pleased with him just because he himself is hardly aware of the remarkable character discernible in him. - You read the Mercury and the notice of uncle? Now farewell
 your P.

did clue - glue leimen, clue hat mit verwirrtem Faden zu thun - find a clue, das rechte Ende ihn zu entwirren.

Herm fürchtete wohl sein Briefchen an Dich könnte heraus fallen. 


1My dear Mr Plebst

I have been unexpectedly detained on Plantation - and fear I shall not be able to go with you to Jackatalla

Shall I lend you a pony to carry you to Kaity? or as far as the top of the big hill? -

If you would like one I will send it to the Coonoor bridge at once - I am sorry I cannot go to Jackatalla today - and am much obliged for your kind suggestions about Waterwheel etc

With our kind regards
 Yours very Sincerely
 N H Stanes.
