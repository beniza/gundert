 Coimb. 1 June 58

My dear wife

This is the first letter from Bosw's house. I drank tea with the A<ddis>* (for the first time, generally I spent the eveng alone) prayed and left about 9 P.M. So only a few words of thanks for the children's letters sent so quickly after yours for them. Time enough if I despatch these after tomorrow. - Fritz's packet has not yet come, but the Mercurys. No sign as yet of a Cooly, perhaps Strobel thought all was for him. What is Erst's letter in Fritz's? But I hope I shall see. - From Ward I got 2 fine pomegranates and promises of many more. No need of troubling Miss Ph. - Grant has not been heard of here, was in Fenn's sermon at Palgh for Str. did invite him and had fellowship with him, tho' green fellow that he is he spent most time in teaching him Hebich's doctrines instead of learning a little from a superior and experienced Miss[ionar]y who is remarkable humble and silent about himself. He <Str.> spoke about prayerbook and praying to Jesus in preference etc etc and I believe fancies to have made a strong impression anyhow they have had communion in the Lord and that is enough. - The boys letter was delayed by the Trieste route. You see they get on nicely, tho' in truth I did not understand all Herm. said and must read it over again. Farewell now for this time It is late
 Your HG.
