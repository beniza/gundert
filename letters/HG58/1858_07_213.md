 21 July <58>*

My dear Marie

It is a wonderful thing how prone we are to fix a day and way for God when he is to convert us. I also thought confirmation ought to do it, and then a communion on Whitsunday 28, the jubilee of the Augsburg confession in 1830 these and others were days when I fancied God might do the thing. But I had not come very low and felt not exactly as if I were lost but for His help and interference, and therefore He permitted me to grope a little longer in the dark. But as Solomon says, we put all the fault upon God's want of inclination; the foolishness of man perverteth his way and then his heart frets against the Lord. It is always the old story: he must be somewhat in the wrong, we have done our best etc. It is wonderful that after all He gets not more tired with us. He is indeed a gracious and patient master. 
Now farewell
 Your Papa
