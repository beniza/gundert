Dear Papa.

Yesterday evening received yours of the 25th for which, thanks. Mr Thomas who spent the night here was glad to hear that Mrs. Francis had asked for a meeting, he came to say farewell to his cousins who are to leave this tomorrow morning. Marie and myself are to see them this evening for the last time. Mrs Grant came in this morning at least the pions told so. Mr Robinson is to be on the Hills in a few days.

Poor Mrs. Conolly how long in darkness and bonds. I wonder at Jacob charging anything for Mrs. Hoch's cow for she has milk Mr Cook here would be glad to get an Aden cow!

The Hodges have anounced themselves for Saturday at least the ladies, while he will go to Malapuram - and come here next Friday after them. they are now at Bepore Mrs H had fever he wrote to Fritz. Samuel's letter is indeed refreshing. In the mission house we shall hear I hope more from Herman I shall be glad to know him in the mission with his brother; by this time they may be going to Bale. they will be very each other with the little ones in the new building. They are seeking a house father for the Kinderhouse May God give the right man. I shall regret Miss Culman for our own children who love her so much; but with the Word after Samuel all is for the good of those who love Him.

With love to all
 Yours aff J. Gundert
