 <Gegen Ende Aug.>* <58>*

Dear Papa.

Many thanks for yours of 19 and for your willingness to take me to Mangalore. I first doubted that it could be realised at all as Fritz intended to leave this on the 3d and be absent three weeks; now he has changed his mind and writes to you about it. As you are just going to Paulghaut he needs not go there now!

Tomorrow D.V. we pay a visit to Mrs Holloway to the Cooks and finish the day with Mrs. Grant. a visit must also be paid to the Glassons who have invited the girls to dine and play there. So you have paid your last visit to Oti and saw many people. May you have been smell of life to many. Your time is now almost finished there. How quick it passes. I hope our dear boys specially Her. for whom it will have been hard perhaps to enter the for Anstalt <Voranstalt>* find also the time going quick. We are rather out of time with our home letters; but you have them ready for next opportunity. Love to all
 Yours
 J. Gundert
