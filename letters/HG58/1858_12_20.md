My dear Mama

3 AM I arrived at Badagherry everything comfortable in the fine moonlight, only the boat was very narrow the better boats havg been taken by the schoolboys escaping from the Provl School to their homes. Examined Gresseux's school, which was in good state - really nice. Evening Chombala happy evening. Bess sends her love, so do the people. Tuesday morning rode to Tellichy, Mrs Buggy's house Sauv's still there breakfast there and examination. Now 2 PM at Nettoor where Hunziker and WÃ¼rtele still are. Mrs S spends the day here for the air. S. continues to be idle and content with himself, poor fellow - Sarah nice - The gardener Sri Candan just dead! (without faith)

With much love
 Your HG
