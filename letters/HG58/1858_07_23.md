My dear Marie

Have you any way tried to paint? Yesterday I saw at Mrs Cockburns beautiful birds about 200 drawn and painted from Nature by their daughter Maggie and she had learned it quite by herself. She likes to show them in her own unaffected manner - and then I regret a little that she has so quiet a life and nothing to disturb her - fine house, splendid garden (of which I send a specimen) every amusement - but no real work, no labor for others, no service. I regret it deeply because I feel how empty life is without that. Be thankful that you have a school to work in day for day, however unladylike it may look.

The Lord be with you and your
 Papa
