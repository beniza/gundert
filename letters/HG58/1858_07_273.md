 Calicut 27th July 58

Dear Papa

Thanks for yours of the 24th I am glad to see you are well and not much to do. The Hodges who are now leaving us send you love and were not surprised at the description of Taylor.

Mr George Thomas has come last night he was expected during the day, but came only at eleven at night.

I had an opportunity to send Arrowroot to Dr Leslie as Mr Fritz was just sending some to the Beutlers I have sent a small* box 36 pounds. I was glad to hear about the Cockburns I wish Magie might get a good husband she is a nice girl. Do you not think you should stay longer on the Hills? 
I had a letter from Mrs Ammann no news she asks me to write to Mrs Leslie about a girl for whom she pays at Mangalore. they are happy with the brethren, was much revived by her visit at Mercara. A nice letter too from Miss Will, You shall get them by and by.

Fritz had a cold, he was nice on Sunday at the Lordsupper I like better the English than the Malayalim. We shall soon get letters again I hope of our dear children!

Love to all the dear people there
 Yours J. Gundert.
