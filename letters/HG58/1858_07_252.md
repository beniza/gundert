Dear Papa

From Mrs. Hodges I hear that Mr Tom Stanes makes beautiful fotographe those the Hodges have made by him are far supirior to any of those made here, if you could get yours made it would be very useful; for all those made before were not good and if I am permitted to say my mind, sit properly while taken you legs not so far from each other and no topi on your head if you can bear it!

Convert has gone to Coilandy, his school counts now 100 boys 50 English schollars! The brethren have often prayer together. Yesterday we paid a visit to Mrs. Fritz's grave with her two little ones or rather three: He took us there and he was very nice. Showed much thankfulness for what the Lord has done for him since her death. By yours of the 21 I see that Tom Stanes had a accident I am sorry for him. Also he will not be able to make any fotograph. Who had news about the awakening or rivival at Shaf? May God bring it also here and convert many heathen. Today we shall have the Lord supper only among us for the Hodges sake as they are to leave us on tuesday Bess Diez writes as if there was a work in Anna. May it be so! as well as with Miss Groves the letter I kept alone
