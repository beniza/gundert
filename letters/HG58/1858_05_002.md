 [Mai 1858?]

My dear Marie.

You will have particular difficulty in translating to Mama all about David - but take the trouble heartily and get through it as verbally as you can, it is full of rich amusement I see him before me as he lebt und leibt. It is truly a treat to see him among the geese, smearing tallow on the window etc (Once he greased a little Maj. Youngs boots with dust, and to justify it said, the Major had promised him to tell a story and after all had not done it, so this was condign punishment!) Ernst is open enough - the dear rogue, as if we wanted doctrines and theories and sentiments of him, instead of a living faith that knows in whom he has believed. Kaund writes as if he was quite bewildered by MÃ¶gl leaving the Mission. He evidently thinks Basle must have dealt very unjustly with him. So you see how differently even God's children look upon the same matter. Does it puzzle you? or can you make it all square - we having the Spirit of God still to disagree so much from one another? Now may God give you grace to be humbled and not offended by all the weaknesses of his servants.
 Your Papa
