My dear wife

I arrived here early - for I did not visit Codacal. Great shame, you will say. But so it happened. I looked out for my way to the right, through the long avenue, but had again and again to hide my face it was so cold in the clear moonlight. So I must have overlooked the ricefield where I ought to have gone off, and was quite surprised by the sudden _____________ to the river. Back I couldn't go - the sun arose when I crossed the Ponany river halfway to this. Abt 8 o'clock I arrived. Strange to say the horsekeeper had insisted I would arrive at Codacal and here Monday morning - so they had been waiting here from Sunday afternoon. I sent the little parcel for Bosshdt with the Manjil. But the nuts I couldn't give in charge of the Mopla bearers. All well during the night, walked a good deal this side of the river and got warm this morning with a fearful SE wind such as I knew not before. Everything went accordg to my desire. Only I had left a little too soon. Had there been morninglight I couldn't have overlooked Codacal. But D.V. I may look in on my return. Bossh. has probably twice made breakfast for me on Monday and Tuesday - Now farewell and may the Lord keep you and Mary and all the good people accordg to His mercy
 Yours HG.
