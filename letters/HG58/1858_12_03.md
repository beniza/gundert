My dear Hermann

Your two last letters have given me joy in the Lord so that the tears of anxiety have turned to tears of joy and thankfulness to Him who has quickned and revived you again to a lively hope, herein is our life and strength in having that lively hope which often becomes very dim by unbelief and sin.

You say to serve the Lord or to be a Christian half is great shame, Yes it is and more than that, it is a great loss to our souls and to the kingdom of our Lord, while it is a gain to Satan and to his kingdom. Glory to God for His work in You. I thank you for your love to my poor Frederic who is very dear to me
 Yours J.G.
