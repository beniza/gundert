2My sweet Paul

Also of you, I heard plenty things, and liked so much to see you in the portrait - You look quite as before, so stern in your look - and with beautiful red cheeks, says Marie David has also some colour, only Freddy remains like his mama, pale, and with his sick look. - Apropos! I have got such a beautiful little bag, I dont know from whom - I dare say, it is from one of the little Gunderts - I like it very, very much - I saw also a large one with Mr Laufer, and he told me, that it had been done by one of the little Gunderts - Papa never travels without his bag - You know your Mimi is still at Mangalore, she would have liked very much to come; but, there is too much work there. I send sincere love and thanks to dear aunt Kulmann, and Miss Burk. With a tender kiss to you -

Your dear mama
 Julie Gundert.
