Dear Papa

Many thanks for yours of the 8th received yesterday and for all the news you give - you made great hurry in Otti. you did not visit any one. What will say Mrs. Schmid and others! Well perhaps you go once more by and by if it does not hurt your health. Are your bowels quite right can you eat every food you get? It is truly nice to hear of alld friends going on well. Poor Mrs. Cummin may be the last and her sister the first! What a grace is that to be kept by the Lord and be made strong in Him Oh for faith Yesterday felt happy in reading of our Lord's temptation and fast during 40 days so much trouble and fighting with the devil for us. Is there any thing He will spare for us since He has done so much. Yes He will also care for the dear boys should they not be received in the Missionhouse. Tomorrow is your meeting day we think of you. Oh may it please the Lord to quicken us and many through us.

We are here all well. I think that Fritz with the brethren have often prayers together!

Now dear papa with love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
