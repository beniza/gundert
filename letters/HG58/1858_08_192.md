My dear Mary

Today I have little time for you the fact is I was fearfully tired after returning this morning and kept off sleep with difficulty. Now 9 PM it comes with power and I will soon give it full sway over me. Lydia also to Mang? I hardly know for what - who knows here there. But if Mama wants her to keep up her Tulu, she may do what appears best.

Not leave you orphelins, or orphans The Engl. Version changes it very unnecessarily into comfortless.

Mrs Schmid asked after you. I also heard that Mrs Holloway is coming up. The younger Miss Phillips is dangerously ill. The Bishop saw her and thought well of her says Mrs Rob. All very silent in the house from the feeling of having a dying person near. The Smythe's also I saw who have asked about you all He looks thinner, she quite the same as at Calicut 
The boys' 3 letters were short enough, soon perhaps they will grow longer. I expect now soon your epistles for Basle etc
 Your Papa
