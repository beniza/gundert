 3 July <58>*

My dear Marie

You are very slow with the letters via Madras for Europe. I wish that in future you rather send them 1-2 days earlier that I know beforehand what I have to pack. Tomorrow early I shall have to run to the post, ask if there is anything from Cal. take it and pack it with the others, all before 8 in the morning. The next letters ought to be here on the 18th, therefore be sent on the 16th. - Halfness is of course our chief sickness. One thing needful, ought to make our souls and desires all sending to one. But wholeheartedness is the rarest thing about us, and a wonder whenever God can obtain it from us. Therefore strive and find out what divides the heart and hate it.

Now farewell
 Your Papa
