 9th July 1858

Dear papa.

Many thanks for yours of the 5th Why should the Hoch s be forced to go home on account of their heath or what? You mentioned the death of Mrs Hodson in one of your letters is it the one who was at Cannanore so ill at times? did she die from the same sickness she had, was she at home. I am glad to hear an other man has joined Abraham even in the time of trouble that s a good sign. Mr Hebich wrote to Fritz that he has been asked to go to Madras, friends will pay all his expenses he is much desired to go. Fritz says that he should go, but who shall preach at Cannanore during his absance, perhaps they will manage from Tellicherry!

I am glad to hear the meetings are increasing. may God speak to many and give faith, to His Holy word, for want of faith souls perish and christians are so lifeless Faith what a wonderful thing, seed of God. May we have more for ourselves and for others to bring them to the Lord. 
Mrs Groves has not yet come to Coonoor? Groves and Jessie are coming from Madras up so it is not likely that they will come to Coonoor says Mrs Hodges. I felt happy and blessed today by the words in 1 Cor 2.9.10. May the Spirit reveal more of those things kept for us and may they be realities to us by faith. I am glad you wrote to Marie the way you did. She has some what to try her, now, as she loved so much to be alone. Herriette is continually with her so dear Marie must studdy her temper.

Now Adieu love to dear Mrs Hoch
 yours J. Gundert
