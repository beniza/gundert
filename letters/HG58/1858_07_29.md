Dear Papa

When the apple came I was rather surprised, before opening the little parcel I thought it was needles or what as you had written one that Mrs Anderson had sent some for me? We were pleased with the smell of the apple and those who did eat of it said it was pretty good, the letters I gave to Mr F. He is somewhat anxious about his Sarah who is said to be weak and often fever. He will soon go to Tellicherry.

Many thanks for yours of the 25th our letters are but two days and yours always three in the way.

How is Tom s heand going on? Mr G Thomas went away the next morning, he was on his way to Cannanore I saw very little of him just at breakfast, he looks very young, he is going to Manga. too to the other Thomas. 
Do they get any news about the upper contry in your quarters? Anything more about Schaffhausen It is soon time to hear from our sweet boys. Mrs Hayes wrote rather a long letter all about nothing cheese, sugar etc. 
Mr F<rancis>*'s liver some what out of order. So Mrs Francis does not come to the meetings Those big people know little how many blessings they lose in keeping aloof; what do they know of the communion of the saints. Love from all and to all
 Yours J. Gundert
