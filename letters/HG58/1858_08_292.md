<Dear papa! I forgot to put in the packet my letter from Jettle, but you read it by and by.>2

 329th August <58>*
Dear Papa

Yettys letter with some of Moegling you will have got yesterday. Yette's one is a thick enveloppe through Triest cost 8 as. You will have seen that on the 7th it is too late for home letters. We have the Lord Sup. As the Glassons are coming it will be rather tiresome for they stay the whole day I think as they did last sunday though I like them I like rest better. Fritz will not go to Tellicherry untill he hears farther news. You will not return so soon as you expected since you will stay at Paulghat a while instead of Fritz. Sauvain has just written to Fritz that all the accusations brought by the people at Cheri are faulse, he is a guilty man, but not of what he is accused. Esther at Chombala has made sad confessions emplicating good number of the Telli people in her case, Eliezer very angrey at her confessions half mind to run away
