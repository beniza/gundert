Mrs Gundert, Calicut

 Coonoor 20 July <58>*
My dear wife

I have seen J Groves - very old, Jessie came to Church, otherwise I have not seen her. Mrs G is gracious when I meet her (drawn in a chair by Burghers) I confess I have no drawing towards their grand company and you can not get them alone. JG. was 6 days here and did not call! - Mr Arb. I never saw since my first visit which he tried to return but found me not at home. It is best not to be too close with great Masters. Mr Rob. will now be at Ooty but I have small chance of visiting him there

Frank Groves will be up here one of these days. I wonder if he will come to see me. Plebst prefers Coonoor by far to Kaity - so do I! Yesterday saw W Stanes' plantation

No news therefore goodbye
 Your HGdt
