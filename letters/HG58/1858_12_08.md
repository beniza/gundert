Dear Papa

It seems to me a long time I had not to take up my pen and write to you therefore I scarcely know any more I would like to know what a night you had and how you feel. Try not to do more than you should for surely it hurts your health. After you had gone we felt very lownely. You did not tell me how much I should give to the writer in case he should ask for anything I shall give him five till your return. I am rather glad that new boy did not go with you for he looks rather stupid; I trust Rama will be well and able to care for you. No news here, Lauffer did not know you had left this till teatime - when he showed his surprise. May you have a good time with Capt T. and other friends

Your tchabook1 has been found on my Almira.

Now it is time to go to school and I have nothing to say but good wishes. 
Love to the friends there
 Yours afftly
 Julie Gundert
