Dear Papa.

Many thanks for yours of the 3d received the 6th Poor Webster how is it that Maggy is not yet married: Mr Fritz just heard from Strobel who had been ill with fever; he was expecting the Cornish with his lady and has nothing in which to eat thats to say no crokery nor any thing. 
We paid our visit to Mrs Grand a very nice looking lady indeed aimiable long face thin some what like Elisabeth Diez, spoke nothing to enable one to see how far piety is concerned in her. Mrs Hodges had much to speak with her about some of their old acquaintances. Marie wrote you yesterday that the price of the west indies arrowroot is 8 as Mr Fritz says we shall have it for less we if you let me know soon what you think about it whether send some or not I shall write to Mrs Irion about it Hodges does not come till saturday, and he will have work here perhaps more than for a whole month she says. I have not yet heard a word as if she had a wish to leave her niece here; she is a nice girl very good temper, not easily offended. 
Marie is nice and grows I trust in the Lord. Here all as usual well according to the body. Fritz nice and kind, had a nice exposition this morning. I liked it He seems also to speak malayalim more fluantly and many new words! I wish I could speak it so well. Love to all there
 Yours J. Gundert.

May you have words of life for the people who come to the meetings and may God give faith to the hearers!
