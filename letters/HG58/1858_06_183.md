Dear Papa

This time we have no letter to answer of course your having gone to Coo makes the delay. No news from any quarter what ever, if Fritz has any I do not know; when you are here it is different some news ore other are told at the table, but now there is a mournful silence; now and then some what in german or the children alone are the subject of the conversation! It is good Marie has always some what to tell you. She is nice, you will find her improved I think when you come back; but her not hearing well is a great obstacle to her learning quickly Malayalim. She gives every day an English lesson. she likes to teach I think.

I read Boswell's memoire with much pleasure, truly he was a fine man. I am far from loving the Lord as he did. What a child like christian he was. I wish and hope to be more independent from creatures see and hear and mind but my Lord. Marie has more of such a mind then me I mean she cares very little for people I am quite surprised some time. May God give me grace to learn all the lessons I have need of!

My love to dear Mrs. Hoch how is my Mariely' and those fine fellows. 
Tell me all about you how the hills agree with you, can you get all what you want? Here all send you Salams and love.

I with love to you and to all there
 yours J. Gundert
