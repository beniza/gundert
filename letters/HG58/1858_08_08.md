Mr Convert has began preaching Malayalim he is liked and understood. 
The Young Gompertz came to bring a letter from his brother sending money to Fritz for six months for Lydia, inquiring after her, desiring to be told when her confirmation takes place and what about her salvation? The younger brother came in yesterday from Bepoor for a Drama or Theatre which took place in the Catcherry last night. the printed notice was sent to us too about it I shall be very glad to see here dear Mrs. Hoch and family. Love to them and to all
 Yours J. Gundert
