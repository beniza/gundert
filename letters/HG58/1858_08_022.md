My dear Mary

Herm's letter to you I sent off already this morning with other letters, some of which will rejoice, others at least interest you. It is very true you want a Rock to rest on - so does every unsteady human heart - and the best is like a reed, the common sort like grass. I hear the Govr Lord Harris is very ill - paralysis or dropsy, at Ooty he was prayed for on Sunday. Should he recover they think of sending him to Europe. It came on very suddenly, it seems partly in consequence of a fall from the horse while out hunting, an accident from which he seemingly recovered, yet has apparently received some deep injury. Today we hear he is somewhat better. Mrs Hoch is still not strong, the Dr. advises her to drink more iron. Theophil also is weakly and Paul very often ill humoured beyond anything I ever saw. I think it is partly from his uncertain state of health. Mrs Hoch remembers the apples and many things which you may refresh in your memory when she comes down on her way to Mang. That may be in Oct. The Whitehouses may be here next Tuesday (10th). The Cullen's also think of coming up, as I learn from her stepmother Mrs Van Someren.

Now farewell
 Your Papa
