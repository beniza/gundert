Dear Papa

Many thanks for your kind letter of the 17th I am glad to hear you are so well; Perhaps it woul be good for you to have a longer leave you might easily get it I suppose, Why do you go so often to Kaity or Otti such long ride cannot do you good! I am sorry my letter to Mrs Huber has been delaid so long where is the fault?

The house was bought when the Hodges went in it else she would have let you know she says I am sorry to hear about dear Pauline being not well. what is it?

Today a beautiful text. May we ask indeed and see the Heathen become the heritage of the Lord and the ends of the earth His properties; It would be time here to see some movements among the dry bones. Oh for more prayers from us for such a season, the promise is made the delay is ours to our shame! I have good times with the girls but besides Lydia not one converter I fear

Mrs. Hodges will perhaps go with him to the Vinade in case Fritz does not go with him it is still undecided, if she goes along they would leave here Herriet and take her afterward to Tell and Cannanore. I like them well the Lord is working no doubt.

Now dear Papa with love to all. May you have a good day tomorrow at the meeting, opened ears, faith in the hearers.

 Yours J. Gundert
