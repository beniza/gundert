My dear wife

Yesterday afternoon proceeded to Vadackencheri, this morning came through extensive forests up and down over the Cochin frontier and am now only 9 miles to the E. of Trichur. Tomorrow early I hope to proceed there when this is to be posted. Little news of such a time. But I am truly glad to enjoy the Seabreeze again which I had missed severely. It is such a difference when you are quietly at home, much more when out and travelling. 
Here Nasranis plenty, but none comes to me, perhaps I seek them in the evening for a little talk. Things are dear Rama wondered how they weighed a fowl before him and he had to pay so much for the _______ and 1/2 _______ The horsekeeper despises the people of his caste here for he says they are one with the (Nasrani) Maplas, viz. eat the same rice. I have here a quiet Sunday, and used it to write a long letter to F. Anderson on some of the points he asks about.

What are you all doing I wonder. Tomorrow I may get letters, which will fall like dew upon a dry ground. For I am sometimes very lonely - at Palgh. Obr quite revived me, he has so given up the care about his children's dress etc and sees so clearly that one thing only is needful. If Nath. be sent away from Chiracal I have thought: might we not call for him as schoolmaster at Veitteri? Ask Fritz what he thinks
 Yours HG.
