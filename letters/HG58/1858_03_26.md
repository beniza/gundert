My dear wife

You will not expect much writing from me lying as I do in a low cabin, which does hardly allow me to sit upright We left Cal. about 5 1/2 the Tindal being of course behind. But I will not grumble as we came on very well and I shouldn't like to land at a hotter hour. Twice I drank of the crew's Canji which refreshed me much, so that I preferred it to arrowroot Sago etc Rama was very attentive and I missed nothing. I may say that the Lord was also attentive accordg to His promise, so I had a good quiet time of it. Took twice a little laudanum which procured me 2 refreshing slumbers during the day. When I land I will send this to the Post but it may be too late for today. 2 ships lie in the roads. If Leslie's house should prove nearer I am nearly tempted to risk stepping in there first, and if invited to stop for I saw in the papers that he is overworked, has no Apothecary to help him and may therefore like having his patients as near as possible. 
Now farewell - plenty love to Marie and the brethren - I hope you are kept from all anxiety seeing that He cares for us
 Yours HGdt
