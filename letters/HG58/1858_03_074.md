My dear Samuel

A few days ago I wrote to Herrman I did not think then of writing to you too, however as there is still time and having had your letters of Janu I will say a few words; in giving thanks to the Lord for his unspeakable grace towards you; in having made known to you His unbounded love on which you feed and rejoice! His joy is our strength and what joy can equal the one that our sins are pardoned our inâ€šquelies covered blotted out. This knowlege made David and other saints to cry blessed is the man, whose sins are pardoned! Glory to God to have opened your eyes on that love which alone enables us to fight the good fight by which also the victory is certain.

I thank the Lord this passing from death unto life has hapened in you before you enter the Mission house and that you are prepared by God Himself for His holy work! And you now feed on that Holy word which makes the man of God perfect and throughly furnished unto all good works. This food is also our sword so beautifully discribed in Hebrews IV.12. When we have learnt to understand a little the exceeding great power of God in his believers Ephe 1.19 we learn also to use the two edged sword. My kind love to dear Mother Aunts and to all relations. As Marie writes too I need not make a long letter! Papa is not so well as he used to be; but I hope with Gods grace he will get well again. With love your Mama
