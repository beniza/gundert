Rev. Dr. Gundert, kind care of Dr Leslie, Cochin

 31 March <58>*
Dear Papa

Yours of the 28th came in hand yesterday eve for which many thanks. Would you like me to go and assiste you, as the Dr has much to do it might be a relief to him and to you if I was there. On monday Convert goes to Coilandi and our visitors will be gone, to day the 5th came Mr. Staine the elder brother, the papa has gone home again. L and Plebst have been desapointed by Mr. Robinson who forgot all about ordering bearers; they heard of it on the point of starting, so they leave only this evening. they live both in your room. 16 of the Tellichery boys came for a week! I wish I be by you and see how you are. What a mercy that your are under such kind care and good treatement; it is the very contrary of what you were here. I knew dear papa you were very ill! had Fritz been here I would not have left you go alone! As you get many letters to day I will not write more. 
May our dear Lord be very near you and bless you all
 Yours J. Gundert
