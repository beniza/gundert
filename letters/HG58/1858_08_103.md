Dear Papa

Many thanks for yours of the 7th. Mr Kaundinga will not belong without following Moeg Buhrer is soon to come out he was the best for the congregation in preaching and dealing with the people in details!

Fritz is to be 10 days or more absent Yesterday little Julie paid a visit to Converts room by the side of mine. as he was writing she went in the bathroom and tried to sharpe his rasor in her little hand when she saw the blood she quickly walked out very silently hiding what she had done, he was much fraitened; but in looking he saw there was no hurt. God be praised for this preservation!

The Whitehouse are on their way to the hills and will see you D.V. she is poorly. Mrs Leslie hopes they may be placed or appointed to Coonoor. 
We are all as usual. Lauffer recovering slowly. still some what yellow. 
 Love to all there
 Yours J. Gundert
