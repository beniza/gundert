 <Cochin 10 Dec 58>*

My dear Marie

I am sorry that I must give you a tremendous answer. You have of course the hypocrite within you, in as much as you inherited it from your father Long after my conversion I was pursued by the feeling: you are not quite true, and I could not shake it off by any effort, Satan stood behind me as if looking over my shoulder and smiling at the discovery of my hollowness inconsistency and incorrigibility in every thing I did. But in process of time I found a change - gradually I got surer and stronger. And if he now tells me this, I say it is true I have the hypocrite about me but I am not merely a hypocrite and Jesus is no hypocrite at all. I never said I am a true man, but rather all men are liars: but then I put on Jesus who is the truth and naturally I am becoming a little more truthful than I am by nature. That will do in common times. For particular temptations you want particular helps and you get them in time of need.

Suppose you get this on Sunday, you may yet answer to me at Quilon. Time creeps away slowly, the schools are not very bright, and I have need of patience. Also little liking for writing reports which yet ought to be the case now. So it goes on as well as it can - happily no illness or pain, only laziness!
 your Papa
