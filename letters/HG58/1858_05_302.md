My dear Marie

This is Trinity day but I did not go to Church, to avoid walkg in the sun. Of course you had better continue writing Engl and even invitg correction till the faults decrease - and the time may come when you can correct me. In all earnest, it is a difference learning a language in your years and in mine. So don't be discouraged - Godd<ard>* is not a common man. There is a depth of heart in all he does - even in his old ways. I have rarely met a more simple - and more concentrated character. He may appear to ramble out touching all sorts of subjects, and yet you always feel that one is deepest and foremost with him. Outward varnish he rejects - tho' he has talents enough for getting up that too in whatever direction he likes. - It is a good sign if you love your bible more than you did - it shows you are less afraid of this unmerciful mirror. It calls light light and dirt dirt, whatever commentary you may look into. You cannot turn its mind - so better turn your mind in accordance with it. I always feel for hours an indefinable effect from earnest biblereading - calming, and yet sharpening the whole inner man, whilst already engaged in other occupations; the Word seems to work on whilst you sleep or work something else. Wishing you to be thoroughly worked by that word I remain
 your father
