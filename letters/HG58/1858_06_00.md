 [ca. Juni 1858]

Dear Marie -

If more was charged on what I sent to Fritz, it must have been because I forgot to write on it (by bookpost), letters and newspapers being charged at different rates. - As for Mrs. B. I should not think it presumption were you to speak openly to her about what you have experienced of Jesus. There are two ways of witnessing - one doctrinal, the other historical. The young must not presume to teach the old, but they may tell them in all simplicity what came to pass with their hearts. So you may state to that Lady what has made you so glad and happy, asking God for a proper moment to do so; and if He likes your speaking of it He will open a door for it. - This must do for the day as I have been interrupted by a visit
 Your Papa
