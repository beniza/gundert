 Coonoor 6 Aug <58>*

My dear Marie

Your homeletters have arrived and go off tomorrow morning with mine. You are mistaken about the boys' vacation. It began the 18th of July (not Aug). The British Messenger I have often seen at Mang. It is indeed useful for stirring us up out of our sleepiness, continually recurring in spite of the workings of the Spirit in and around us!

The Revival in America is truly wonderful. I wonder if it will profit the cause of the 3 Millions of slaves. If it does not I hardly know if some great judgment is not to be expected to befall the nation.

May our brother Ludwig be reached also by this great warning. I wonder whether Fritz has returned from Staefa. The last letters contained nothing about him - and I am rather anxious as he seems to be impervious to influences from those commonly about him.

Now farewell and may the Lord give us a happy meeting. I hope to be with you about the 7th of September, as I must visit Palgh and Ponany on my way  Your P.
