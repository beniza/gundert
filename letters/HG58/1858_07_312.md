My dear wife

only a word with this I will write tomorrow. The news first that Gomp has brought Capt Taylor of the I. Navy to Jesus, and he T. preaches now to Fisher, Williams etc. 2 Soldiers converted in Gomp's meetings it seems! You know T. kept the sister of Goddard's concubine. - Mgl is now separated from Basle - by correspdce begun at Triest. I am sorry for it, he did not even go there, had Karl brought to him. Our boys and brother have seen him at Stuttg and TÃ¼bingen. But I will send you Pauline's extracts. - Tom St's hand is slowly coming round. - Nothing yet from our boys? Now it's Sunday 1 Aug I hope we shall have a good day farewell
 Your HG
