Dear Papa

Many thanks for yours of 17th It would have been too late for us to write to our Her and Samuel I thank the Lord to have taken our dear boys in the Mission house more so for Herman than for Samuel, for the first wants an hedge round him and a yoke to bear, may he have grace to bear it and get the blessings attached to it. May the Lord blesse what you have written him in you last and bring him in the feet of Christ as Paul seems to be and rejoice.

Marie is thanks to God going on pretty well. Mrs Holloway is going on the Hills she is troubled with fits of convulsion it seems. One said here that Miss Philips is ill have you heard any thing of it?

Mrs Grant came yesterday evening in passing by. I hope to see her this week D.V. Miss Cook is better. Next week we have the Lord supper. 
May dear Moegling seek a straiter way than he had of late it is sad to think of so many little or great things in which a want of uprightness is palpable to all.

Fritz wrote you yesterday Are you quite well? Should you not stay a month more on the hills? Adieu dear Papa We are all well love to all  yours J Gundert
