Dear Papa

Have you written to Madras to send you your papers where you are going? 
Major Young has sent two newspapers the Wittness Mrs Fritz there are no news important in them tell me shall I send them to you and the Atheneum. Perhaps till tomorow we may get news of your arival at Palg. so I will only send this tomorrow, I may till that get some letters for you, I long to hear how this rain agrees with you, if you should feel unwell I hope you will quickly go to Coimbatoor in a Palankeen. Your dear letter of Maniaculam came to hand yesterday night for which thanks. But it is very bad of Paul to let all the trouble to Rama! Mrs Rob paid a visit to inquire how you were. I feel much for Hodson and hope the Lord will give words to dear Gompertz for him. How much trouble has the Lord with us and others to bring us fully to Him

Here all as usual; may God give us a good season a reviving time it is indeed much wanted. May those who have grace pray earnestly and bring down a showr of the Holy Spirit promised to prayers

With love to St and Ob
 yours Julie Gundert
