My dear Mary

In three weeks from this I hope to be at Palghaut, in 4 at Calicut. I also feel like you that life passes quickly. When a boy at school - I remember that passing from Kirchengasse through the covered way - where prints are sold and hanged out for show - to the Gymnasium, I often wondered when at last the time would come that I might be free from this eternal going up and down. A year was something very long then I do not find it so now. 
Nor do I think the happiness of childhood and youth so great as poâ€°ts etc describe it, I rather think I am much more happy now than at any former period. You will I hope feel the same and may grace enable you to pass through all these changes with a grateful heart. Mrs Moerike has an erysipelas (Gesichtsrose) which keeps her at home.

 Farewell
 Your P.
