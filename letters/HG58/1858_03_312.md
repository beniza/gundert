My dear wife or Br Fr.

Again a day without a letter. I do not understand it, but it must be for the best

This night I had a gracious visitation in answer to prayer - soul very joyful, and body 8 hours without discharge - tho' not a moment's sleep. Such close nights - I laid myself at last besides the peon under the porch of the house to have at least a breath of air.

If you have not departed, don't come, for I shall soon be quite set up again -

A secret - I sent in my resignation to Arbuthnot - it is the only course in which I felt comfort: and I know God will have it so.

Early next week I hope to look out for about to take me to the North 
Love to all
 HGdt
