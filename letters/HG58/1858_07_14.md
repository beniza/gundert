 14 July <58>*

My dear Marie

At Kaity I read in the Heidenbote an amusing story. The workmen had begun to pull down the house, and the children had seen what was going on during the day. In the evening they gathered round an outhouse (Waschhaus) and pelted the windows with stones. Mama or aunt <Culmann>* was quite petrified by this inexplicable piece of audacity, but the answer to her question was: Isn't all to be pulled down? we only wanted to help. I am sure David sent his stone through the panes with right good will. - "H. and I am going well" - are probably. "Can speak of it so indifferent" - tly. 
You see what is the use of not being alone. You have to exercise a much greater watch over your temper and need more seeking God's help in prayer. Oh what stories we discover in our heart, when another comes athwart our way. He deserves to be hanged, is the immediate judgment of our heart. So easily do we kill people in thoughts at least. I fancy Jesus growing up in Mary's narrow little cottage will have had many a sore trial with "his brethren and sisters". But how wonderfully will he have passed through all these temptations without offending against the law of love, which he laid down at least for Himself to love the neighbour better than himself (not as himself)

Now farewell - No homeletter arrived
