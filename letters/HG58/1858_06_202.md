Dear Papa

A sunday service done; indeed that prayer book reading every sunday is more a service than an injoement. Is it not for children of God for a true minister who has the Spirit of God like opium to repeat always that service. Can it be according to God's mind that a congregation composed half or three quarter of unconverted people come every sunday repeat the confession of sin and receive the absolution of the same. is not the minister in some measure answerable of the deadness of the congregation by using that deadening way and letting the people sleep in giving the absolution to people he knows well are under the wroth of God since they have not believed in the Son of God and have no mind to leave off sin?

Mr Convert is again sick much diarrhea. Fritz says that he has brought it on in eating pine Aples of which he did eat indeed rather much. 
No letter as yet from you; but I trust this evening we may get one, it is very rainy and the tapal will be three days coming from Coonoor I suppose. Fritz has sent some English books to Stroble. We are thank God well except Con. 12 0'c comes your dear letter of the 16th for which many thanks, it was very kind of dear Moerike to come and meet you and of dear Ple and M. to wait for you, how is dear Plebst! You can tell us by and by plenty news from all quarters.

Now with love from all and mine to you all
 Yours J. Gundert
