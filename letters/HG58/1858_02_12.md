My sweet Paul

Last time I wrote to my precious Frederic I think. I often speak of you with Marie. Do you still desire to have wings? When you were very young you wanted by all means to get some and once you looked under your arms to see if really they were not already coming! I like to remember that and to think that soon you will get the common wings given to the believers: all of them want some to run above and see there. I think they consist partly of faith; As it is given from above to men and children it goes again and again above and brings fine gifts from heaven to those who like these sort of wings Would you like such to look in heaven?

Marie has a little dog which she calls Ami I wonder what you are doing now playing, learning and what thinking. I was glad to hear you are learning more diligently and are obedient. How did you like your birthday? 
With a tender kiss
 Your Mama
