My dear Marie

Today I was at Kaity and returned about 6 PM rather tired. What should I find but our letter of the 14 Febr addressed to BÆ’le which place they could not find at Marseilles. It contained yours to Marie Monnard, to which I added a postscript, saying that now there was something new. It brought back to my mind how thankful we ought to be in looking back on old days, seeing the Lord has already wrought so many changes since which all show him in his real character as the Wonderful in Counsel. - It is impossible to become more naughty after one has prayed! If this happens the prayer was no prayer but lip service, and there is certainly no promise that lip service drives out naughtiness. But it is quite plain that even the prayer of the unconverted if only sincere, solemnizes them and makes them more open and pervious to influences from above. So your friend must be still wanting in sincerity, not really seeking but merely pretending to seek. That may give her a respectable character among men, but not with God, who likes honesty above all

Now farewell
 Your Papa
