Dear Papa

Your two desired and welcome letters from Palg came yesterday a few hours after each other. Thanks to God for His loving kindness and tender mercies tu us sinners. The news about Joseph could but be expected he has alway been a rog and darkness itself. I was indeed pleased at Marie consenting to devide work for every hour and hope she will continue stadily. We have prayer daily together may God not allow the devil to come between us. Fritz said he hoped no house would be bought without the Coms consent. I thought you are careful anough in those things to know what is to be done! I am glad you have good time with Strobel. We surely cannot pray invain if we do it with faith. May there be a real blessing on Strobel s begining. Here all as usual Fritz very kind to Marie and to me.

With love
 yours J. Gundert
