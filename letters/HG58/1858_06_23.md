Dear Papa

Many thanks for your few lines after your return from Kaity; it is rather a quick business, you said you would stay a week at home before venturing much out. Well I dont know what is good and right only evoid putting yourself in a hurry. Too much haste is bad for body and soul! I send you at once Mrs Y.'s letter you will kindly return it that I can answer it by and by. My thanks to Mrs. Hoch for her letter. The Hauff think already like old Indian people regarding roon and comfortableness! The bull did not cost anything; but the pattimar which has been repaid by the Kindersley at least if you mean that bill of Pf. Has it not been sold to Fenel? if not kindly tell Pf to sell it we dont want it here!

How is Rama I trust his sleeping without a blanket the first night did not hurt him? many natives get fever at first there! Babu is sick and has put in his stead a stupid boy who knows nothing

We hear nothing of the Hodges as yet; In the bundle I send you the children measure a piece of string.

Kindly write to Mrs. Y. all news possible you can answer all her questions about the people she asks. I know so little of every thing now that I pray you to say all for me. With love from all to you mine to all there  Yours J. Gundert
