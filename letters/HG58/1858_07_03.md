 Coonoor 3 July 58

Dear wife

Today young Boswell visited. He is very hearty, liked Strobel, is now departing soon for Vizagap. but will first go with Metz into the District. In B's memoir you will see letters addressed to him by his dear uncle. 
I saw the Darling's today. A nice family somewhat oldish (40 years in India) their 8 children mostly grown up and promising. Today for the first time a little rain. - I write to Stuttg and Young therefore little time. 
Accompanied yesterday Hoch to Jackatallah, where he has the evening meeting on Friday. Boy the Hospital Serjt is a fine man, the others 8-9 rather dull. Webster a drunkard keeps aloof his Maggy they fear is led astray. Kies happily returned to Guledag the rebellion there nipped in the bud but Brahmans and noblemen wish to have the old days restored, and may still try another rising. The Lord will watch over the Mission.

No time to write to Basle. I will try via Bombay within a few days. Strobel rode back to Palgh in one day - enough to spoil all but the Lord has shown him that he must leave these Griffin ways.

Farewell
 Your HG.
