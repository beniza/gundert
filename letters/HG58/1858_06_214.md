Dear Papa

For how long have you leave? What is the meaning of Gabriel? We have again a fine day today it chears one to see the sun. What news has dear sister Hoch of her family. Our children in future will be very near her father s house I trust our little ones will make good acquantace with the dear Mama Ecling! Has the little Marie been suffring that she looks poorly? Convert is better. Lauffer is very diligently learning to play on the Armonium morning early he is there and at night. Convert has given it up saying that he has no gift for it while Lauffer knows it already better than himself. How is our T. Stanes still childlike and nice. Is Moerike quite well or still some symptoms of the old complaint?
