Mrs Gundert, Calicut

 <Coonoor>* 25 July <58>*
My dear Marie

I do not think Mr Heb. will pass through Calicut nor even thro Ooty where he is more wanted: but his way will go by Bang. straight to the Eastern Coast.

It is a great grace if we can draw near with a true heart (as Hebr X,22). The heart easily becomes untrue again, as we are born hypocrites and formalists, ready for any dead work and lipservice rather than for a real priestly approach to our father's throne

<Revd>1 Miss <Gundert>1 is invited to be a priest indeed, that means one who likes coming near God and bringing to Him Sacrifices of praise and thanks, together with the sighs and wishes of her poor heart. But if she prefers distance and compliments, He can be distant too and keep her at arm's length. You will now make all sorts of experiences how the heart shifts and turns every way before it becomes quite subdued and weaned, and seeks above all Rest in the father's bosom. Christ however continues interceding for us in our way ward moments. What would else become of us, when Satan tries to sift us as wheat.

Farewell now for two days. Tell me if the apple was good. I have not yet tasted any up here.
 Your Papa
