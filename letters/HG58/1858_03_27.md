My dear wife

You will have got my letter of yesterday which I posted myself on my way to Dr or Whitehouse. As I could not hear distinctly where the Dr lived I entered at Whitehouse's found there old Mrs Baker with her consumptive daughter who had come to consult the Dr. So there was no room for me. But it had been settled already that I should get a room at the Dr's who had taken d'Albedhyll's house close to Whitehouse. So I had been well directed. Dr Leslie received me most kindly, gave me 2 rooms, enquired into every thing connected with my complaint and began at once to treat me. Day and night he is nearly always about me doing every thing himself (even going enema's) and hopes soon to set me up again, but demands perfect rest and probably a longer stay here than I had calculated. But this he did not say explicitly. I have not seen Mrs L. but she directs Rama in making my Canjis etc. They have only one child with them, just weaned. I must say I couldn't have fallen into better hands L. is always ready for some good talk. Also Whiteh. is nice and kind. Now farewell - love to you Marie and all the brethren. Give thanks that all goes so well
 Your HG
