 August 2d <58>*

Dear Papa

A propos We shall be glad to get books at your return I mean for the girls to write your economical coppybooks of which everyone of us make use. It is indeed sad to hear of Mrs D. as not being converted after such a high profession. So Plebst is to be rather long absent. Will the Hochs be coming down with you? Dear Mrs Beaman <geb Gompertz>* she might have known before he was unconverted and worse than that. Well she has perhaps come to this for his conversion how ever painful it may be now. Is Miss Hale a living christian? I wonder we have nothing from America as yet about our brothers having turned to the Lord
