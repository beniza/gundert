My sweet dear Paul

Your letter with those of your brothers gave us much joy a few days ago. Papa and Marie are caring that every one of you may get stamps. where ever Marie sees one she takes it I was specially pleased to hear that you become diligent in your lessons, and are obedient. If you pray every day to our dear Lord Jesus He will help you and you will find it easy to do all what you may have to do and learn! Last time I wrote to my sweet Frederic now I can only send him here a tender kiss with plenty love! Dear Marie and papa are I trust writing to you and to him. We have here a monkey which got lose today and amuses the girls very much he runs after them and they cannot catch him. Mr Fritz said he would kill him; but all the girls beg for the life of the monkey!

My very dear Paul Adieu. Kiss and love from your Mama
