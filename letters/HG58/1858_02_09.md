Dear papa.

Two days no letter from you; but I think there is a fault in the tapal. Yesterday Lowson was here who said that he had reported against the Cochin tapal officers. Mr F told him he might do it for this place too for they are very careless. letters from the north were kept from morning till evening only because they were waiting for the Madras Tapal to take all the letters together. No news here. All pretty well look with patience for sunday to see you D.V. returning. This morning rather warm no land wind therefore last night pretty hot already. Marie goes afternoon with Adelle and Julie to see the Wells, I feel that I want grace to see and know. M in the true light and want help to deal according to Gods mind. Now and then I am puzelled and heavy for the heart is intirely far far from the Lord. It is nothing for Him to bring her nigh: may we have grace to pray 
Love from all
 yours J. Gundert
