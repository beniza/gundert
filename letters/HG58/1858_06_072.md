My dear Marie

Harriet knows and remembers you of course, tho' she is so much older and has been 18 months governess in Engl. She looks very steady and quite English. I truly like what I saw of her. She seems not afraid of meeting the beard either and answering his questions. I wonder what you will manage to communicate to each other - will you succeed in convincing her that you have commenced to belong to those funny people the pilgrims and strangers. Only try heartily and then little time will be lost in beating about the bush. Mrs Hodges will be very glad to see your Mama again after more than 10 years. I find her truly nice, humble and open and Hodges too - they know much of many Christians, and are a walking chronicle, having been so long in the country. - I perceive an improvement in your English - but you cannot f.i. say - what would I become so happy! but "how h. would I bec. You hope the stay on the hills will perform a perfect recovery "for some time at least". This reads strangely - as if you had only hope for a momentary improvement, but looked upon my afterwards getting worse again as upon a necessity that cannot be avoided. But it is of course only the turn given to your sentence. I am glad you spend some hours with Mrs Bean. My regards to her and Mrs Rob.

Now farewell. The Lord keep thee
 Thy father
