 Mang 12 Jan 58

My dear wife

Saw Mary this morning but not afterwards till the evening when I took her to the Tuesday meeting. What a time that I have not heard from you, it seems an age. But nobody will call it wrong if you write a letter though it may no more come in time to reach me. - It appears that the Bander boat has been detained by Heb at Cann and so he is the cause if I cannot come early. Anyhow I trust that tomorrow I take anything that has a Cabin or shutroom, and get the things in so as to leave by Thursday morning After all it may be Friday evening that we meet. Today hardly any wind. - Plenty work still and better schoolmasters offer than I could have expected, but I have no wish of making further excursions as I ought to get to Palghaut and Cochin. 
The 2 new brethren <Hauff and Finckh>* are perhaps the 2 most Unenglish ones we have seen out for a long time. They are truly nice, but may be long before they speak fluently. Why does nobody write about the doings in Malabar. Surely the Balm. brethren ought to know what is going on. - Mary speaks rather nicely to Mrs Handibo, Nancy etc I mean not making too much of herself however giddy she may be at heart.

She is the Lord's, I mean at least in His hands and there we will leave, into these commit her
 Yours HG
