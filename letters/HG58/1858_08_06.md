My dear wife

If Grant comes to fetch me I will go up with him. There need be no trouble about it as I may leave soon after the dinner is over. But I let it be determined by his coming or notcoming. I hope you feel less fidgetty and can <take>* things coolly. Why seal your letters threefold? I do not know what to say about Marie. My impression is God will show it to us as time progresses; for the present I see no need of hurrying to a decision. Mrs Hoch sometimes unwell Theophil better. BÃ¶singer sent a new Daguerrotype of mine Now fareewell and keep quiet
