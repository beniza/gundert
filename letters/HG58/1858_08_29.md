My dear wife

Only a few words to thank for your news about Cann. and Chir. sad as they are. I fear the Sauvain's are out of the way and it will be hard for them to find it again. I pity Hebich to be so thwarted by their strange spirit, but our Lord will also turn it to some good purpose.

On Saturday I was with Tom <Stanes>*, but the face would not come, although he did his best. Then came a note from Arbuthn. to invite me there and it seemed as if all business was just waiting to beset me on my last day. Mrs Scudder came to demand of me a Tamil service - I agreed and preached once more to both Congregations - saw Abraham the fine Badaga Christian who also speaks Tamil, bid farewell to Mrs Lawson and other good people, talked with Moerike till I was well nigh tired - and then the packing all along, whilst Arb's business demanded all my papers to be on the table -

Therefore you have a short allowance for this time but I am thankful for the day as I felt the Lord enabled me to do a little in His House. Farewell - a kiss to Marie and love to the brethren
 Your HG
