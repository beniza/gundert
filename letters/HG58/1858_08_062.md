Dear Papa

Next time such letters of our children come glued on every side as was the last it shall be sent you without opening; for Marie and myself did what we could to spare it. The Lady I ment was Mrs. Bean!

Fritz left this for Tellicherry and Cannanore. his children are here, I am also quiet satisfied and pleased about the news of your Uncle. I did not mean to say any thing against him nor judging at all.

Mrs Moegling has returned the letters amongst them was one from Haller discribing his journey his wife in a palankeen and he in a Mangile. He hopes she will soon be famillar with Europe and distrust natives.

The Grants paid again a visit without ours having been paid. She is a fine christian.

Miss Cook very ill not much hopes of her recovery:

I am sorry to hear Mrs Hoch and children are not well; but they may like many feel the benefit of the hills afterwards only

With love to them all
 Yours J. Gundert
