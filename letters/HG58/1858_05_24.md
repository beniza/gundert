To Dr. H. Gundert, Dy Inspector of Schools, Coimbatur

 24th <May 58>*
Dear Papa

Yours of the 21 made me to think that you were less well since you spoke of going to Coimbatur sooner than you thought at first. now by yours of the 22d shows me that indeed you have been worse. I am glad you take canji I think if you can possibly bear it and drink it, it will be much better than so many remedies. Tell Rama that he must put very little arrowroot and beat it well in pouring the boilling water on it As Mr Fritz is going to send some thing to Str I shall send some more arrowroot <and three bottles of port> for you to reach you at Coimbatur. Let me know please how it is with you, how many stools in day and night, what nature, do you sleep well, have you pain. Tell me all please else I run to see you! Mr Robinson removed as you will see by the Gazette Mrs with one of the Miss Philips are to stay here for a month longer, as she expects her confi every moment. R says that the gentleman expected in his stead Mr Grant is a nice man pious and every thing desirable, he is a friend of him both schotch Fritz will write to Strobel. May the Lord bless you make you perfect in every way. May our brothers be amongst the converted in America. I wish Strob had a good servant instead of that Paul! Dear papa I longue to hear again how you are 
 with love yours J Gundert

Mrs Bean and the R send love
