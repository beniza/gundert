My dear wife

Today I had just finished translating Ecclesiastes when the homeletters arrived. I now send them at once. They will refresh you. Sami is not only very solemn, but also - nearly for the first time quite gay - David amused him so much. But you will be particularly pleased with what he writes of Hermann. This is indeed good news. I like it particularly because Sam. would not have spoken so freely of the temptations of Satan if he had not felt that indeed they were past. We must also feel for Herm in his being so very busy till the last day - Surely the Lord meant it for good when he laid all this work on him. Mrs Lawson sent me a letter I enclose with 20 Rs - so she did to Hoch too. I like her indeed very much - a true mother in Israel, and thorough Scotch came only out to accompany a married daughter to India. Dear humble people! I shall quite miss the Congregation here, so attentive and even where they disagree careful to stick to the matter and not to be offended with the person. You rarely find so many of this kind together on our coast - not even at Cannanore. - My time draws to a close. Mrs Groves gives me bacon, a ham and preserves. Other jars come from other people. I think already of packing and have sent orders to the Cutwals etc. Once more I shall D.V. write when I have slept for the last time here. 
 Farewell
 Your HGdt
