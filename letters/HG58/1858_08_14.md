My dear Marie

I also heard from Chomb and hope that Anna will now push on as she has something to live for. Many people of weak intellect are seen to become really clever merely by turning their hearts* to one great object, instead of trifling as they did with life and death. - With your Malayalam we shall perhaps have to try a new plan. When I see you we shall consider about it. Mrs Moer does not yet know much about the language as she is I think much occupied about her house and baby, and has often some ailments, such as cold and erysipelas which keeps her from the open air perhaps too much. Next Monday they will go to Kotergherry Their Theodor begins to walk and is a fat fellow very different from the tiny Mary Hoch.

Mrs Hauff had a girl the 6 Aug. All well, Nancy helped

 Now Good bye (not bey)
 Your P.
