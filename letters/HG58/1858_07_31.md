 Calicut 31 July <58>*

Dear Papa

Many thanks for yours of the 27th Fritz had told me of the fine death of Floyd I remember him well he had a smell of Christ indeed all about him. he had with him two little girls whose parents were drankards one of them had been brought to the Lord by Floyd. And our Uncle <Simeon in EÃŸli>* has gone too in peace Glory to God for this too though one would have liked to hear more of his life being truly in Christ. Mrs Mead I remember well she looked rather dead, boasted much how in a moment she could teach girls to mark etc 
Am I mistaken with Herman's letters? but is it not true that there is little in it of what rejoices the heart? I trust you have returned well from Ooty not too tired. Esau has come from Coilandy I have always a joy to see the man. had we a few more like him in the congregation prayers made by them might do great work

Next week Fritz goes D.V. to Telli Mrs <Bean>* has less of God than I thought Yesterday I tryed to speak; but she is darker on the needful thing than she appeared before According to Herman's letter, we shall get news of Yette, here nothing has come from her.

Now with love from all to you and mine to all there
 Yours J. Gundert
