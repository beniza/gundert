My dear wife

Very tired today from writing homeletters, therefore excuse shortness. Yesterday the Moeriks came from Kotergh where they had stayed some days with the Cockburns and learned to like them more than could be done from a distance. They seem all, but esp. Davy to talk often to the Badagas about Christ and can give Moer. hints about the different stages in which the several hearts are now moving. Frank has been asked to provide the Governor with game and shoots in one day 2 jungle sheep, 2 hares, 3 jungle fowls and 2 spur fowls. The Gov. they say is now going to try Kota hall for a time. - I think Obrien should yet for a time be at Palgh, where I think him more wanted than at Cannanore whilst Heb. does not leave it. But of course I am in favor of Heb's travelling, as he seems so particularly blessed to the white, whilst MÃ¼ller will be able to look after the black Congregation. But I believe the Comm. will decide in favor of Heb's travelling esp to Madras which may well require him. Now farewell
 Your HGdt
