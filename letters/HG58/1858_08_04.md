 Calicut 4th Aug 58

Dear Papa

Yours of the 31 has given me great joy by hearing of the work done by the Lord at Mangalore. Ask and ye shall receive what a wonderful thing is that to be able to believe. Good hopes now for the family at Ancola how many prayers are now offered for them from fathers and children. Dear Gomp may the Lord give him more and more souls. May we also get children in the Lord, and soon hear of our dear brothers in America having come too. The Lord is good to me I have happy times in Him and hope He will work with the girls for whom He gives me more prayers and patience. I was struck in reading in 2 Corin 6 chap how much Paul had born in serving the Lord patience, affictions necessities, distress, watchings, fastings, longsuffering, and Elas what are we! no wonder that souls are not brought to the Lord, we are to lasy and have not learned to bear any thing as yet for His sake. There is an awful blindness in those who are sent in all of us. Had we been truly burried with Him we would also be risen with Him and have power, becoming truly smell of life, unto life Oh how backward we are how can the Lord use people who have still so much of self. I grieve for Moegling he did not go a strait corse in all this weavering. Have you seen his letter in the Christian Herald, before he left India. Lauffer is not well, very yellow even his eyes. Love to the dear friends with you
 Yours J. Gundert
