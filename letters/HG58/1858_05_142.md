 Calicut 14th May 1858
Dear Papa

What a rain I wonder where you are and what doing. Have you got wet? and how is it with you? had you to go out of the Manjil during the rains and how many times? What with the food. You forgot to take shiroots with you I think! One cannot doubt but this is the monsoon. every evening from 5 it pours down incessantly. Paul left on the 14th about 11 Oclock his wife I have not seen but when they arrived. Samele Diez still very ill. Of Mrs Hodson Mrs Deg writes how she sank at the sight of her dead baby and the next morning both in one grave. How loud the Lord speaks to that man. I hope you are not troubled about your work and that the Lord will show you what is His will, if what had happened in that night of your sickness should have been a mistake at Cochin. Here all as usual, our part of the house very empty and melancholy. Convert deranged in his stomac. Fritz says its the pineaple

Tell me all about yourself!

Marie is nice, sits at school the whole day; but I will try that she rides every day a little, next time I shall send a few lines to the children. The last day you were here you felt better than usual do you not think that the Canjie you took that morning did you good. How is doing Rama? 
With good wishes for much peace and joy of the Holy Ghost

 Yours aff
