My dear wife

I am still tired today havg yesterday visited Kaity and come back for the meeting hour. My sleepiness must account for Marie getting nothing today. What she writes about letters for home I donot understand. My letters must explain themselves with the help of the dates to which they refer. I doubt if I shall send any more letters to Europe ere I reach Cal. but it may be from Ponany as I explained last time. I hear Miss Philipps is somewhat better and goes to Coimbatore for a change. Mrs Groves sends a ham, bacon and 2 jars preserves. I shall try to bring 1-2 apples to. But the Cooly trouble annoys me, probably I take a bandy for the things from Palgh till Calicut. - Kindly order bearers for me from Ponany to Calicut on the night of Monday 6 - Tuesday 7th September or no - I think I must do it myself farewell  your HG.
