Dear Papa

I have to thank you for two letters 9th 11th If letters come to us we shall open and read, it is soon time to get them, With Mrs Grant we are to spent a day but we must wait till Fritz return. The Miss Cook is the one who was very delicate not the one engaged to T. I hope your Rama is well again That is indeed loveless of Whitehouse to treat so dear Strobel. I hope dear Tom Stanes will not be offended too long at the word!

Thursday at noon came dear Obrien who wanted to leave again the same evening after 21 miles march, Convert who was glad to discharge himself of the Friday preaching invited him to stay and take his task which he accepted joyfully, and glad I was to hear him hoping meanwhile it may do good to our people too. The Lord gave him a good and impressing word for those who have an ear opened about the love of Jesus whose love seems to fill his heart. I was much rejoiced and blessed by his visit. Oh may we get many Catechists like him and many Missionaries! He inquired much after you even with tears. He said that Strobel had been the means of the conversion of the young man Rehling, that he is truly changed and fine! Ob will meet Fritz at Coilandy where he is to spend next sunday. Fritz wrote that Hebich is not to go on his journey before there comes an answer from the Comity The christians of the hills do not improve it seems in keeping at home or as Mr H. would say their tongues.

Now with love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
