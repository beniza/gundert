Dear Papa

Many thanks for yours of 13th To day we may get home letters! Marie says that Lydia asks whether one will take her to Mang she heard me saying that if you have to go there and you would take me along I would like to go if it is God's will for a little change or trip which might perhaps take place with the Hochs when they go back. Mrs Leslie has sent many thanks for the Arrowroot, they were very glad of it, her letter you shall get with other written paper when occasion occur.

Does your health continue to improve? Are you perfectly free from the sickness you suffered from. Here many people are troubled with fever and rhumatism.

With love to dear Sister Hoch and to the other friends
 Yours J. Gundert.

When you see Mrs Moerike kindly ask if she could take a few pieces of Edgings the girls work to sell it for the school if yes I would send it by Mrs Hodges
