My dear wife

I hope you do not think of sending me Europe letters without reading them first. My remark about the nervousness in opening them, was not meant to annoy you: if it did so I am sorry and beg pardon. - I am glad you are content with the Grants. Try to make a nearer acquaintance with her - which Miss Cook is so ill? the 2d? - On Friday we accompanied Pl. on the road to Kaity, Saturday he returned from there for the Lord's supper in Kaity they had announced one but changed their minds afterwds. So Pl. is still here; we had perhaps 25-30 people yesterday, also Hay the Mang. Officer, whom I had visited and spoken to, took the sacrament, of which I was rather glad, as he is very shy of coming forward. In the evening I preached about the fall of the believer (accordg to Hebr X.26. probably much to the dislike of Mrs Groves and other High Calvinists who seem to think that this word cannot be taken as it stands. But I am sure it must!

Carr has again written, has to pass his time in a miserable village without supplies, his sepoys without clothes.

Strobel is very sorry to have to send Obrien off as Fritz demanded; however he obeyed and today Obr. goes there

My Ramen is today for the first time unwell, wants an emetic or what. Hope it will soon go off, for tomorrow I must send Ramotti to Metapalayam for Whitehouse who asks for a pony

 Farewell
 Yours HGdt
