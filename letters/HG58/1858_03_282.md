My dear wife

Yesterday evening your and Mary's letters rejoiced me much. But I cannot answer them. In fact the Dr grumbled yesterday when he heard I had written as he demands absolute rest. He offered to write to you but I said that would frighten you. Any how I may give you the news that he says the worst symptoms are over. But he still weakens me by emptying me thoroughly. It was good I came under such effective treatment. He is always about me and enquiring, confesses now that the first day he was somewhat anxious about me So give thanks so far and be without fear.
 Your HG

I chiefly wanted no business letters, nothing to bother me. What you have of nice things send. Write to Basle etc without me.
