 Calicut 20th <Decb 58>*

Dear Papa

I hope you had a good night and did not catch cold by the strong shoar wind which blue yesterday evening. Rama had no Cambell how is he? From Coimbatoor Mrs A writes that her daughter is detained in Bombay being too ill to be taken by sea at present. They have been expecting Strobel for 10 days seeing nothing of him they suppose he has gone to Cannanore to meet his bride! Fritz wrote to Conv. very tired of the journey.

A letter from Hoch and from Hooblee one from Tellicherry are waiting for you else nothing last evening no Thomas came. Hesechais' wife very much the same, Sipora at Coilandi is said to have become mad. Mr. Thomas has just been here with Mr. Minshon who landed here yesterday a neveu of Major Min. he goes to the Vinad. Thomas is going too to the Glasson's on the 24th. Then to his brother Henry for a month. He supposes the Haultains will not return here. The weaving shop brought Thomas and Minshon as the latter wants clothes.

Fritz found all well at Paulghat the schoolmaster better than he expected However Stroble hopes you will be able to recommand one teacher in his stead.

The repairs of the house if at Cali* might be done in a fourtnight but at Paulg where Strobel nor Paul have not much energy or knoweledge it will take longer. Here all well. Love to the dear people
 yours J. Gundert
