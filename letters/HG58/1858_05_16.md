To Dr. H. Gundert, Deputy Inspector of Schools, Palghaut, stamped 

 <c. 16 Mai 58>*
 Sunday

1My on dear father only a few words to remember you of me. I think often of you, may the Lord accompany you! A worm kiss of your daughter Marie 
2Though I have no news I will write a few lines, no letter as yet from you. I long to hear how you have reached Palg I regrette much you did not make your journy in a palakee you would not have been exposed in that way to the weather. Convert still poorly, Capt Francis paid a visit yesterday. He will see you on his way back at Palg. I have as well as Marie sent a few lines to the little ones in Bale by Fritz who was writing. No home letters as yet. It continues to pour down incessantly with much wind. Where are you I wonder? and Stroble? Here all as usual, to day fine text; but no life. May God give us a revival and quickening season. What a sleep what death Which is the opiom whih makes us to sleep? With love
 Yours Julie Gundert

The rest of Marie; letter will follow by and by
