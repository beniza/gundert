 18th Aug <58>*

Dear Papa

Thanks for yours of the 15th The Bale letters that is to say Ostertag and our pets have been sent in the mercur. I trust you got all safe. The Bill we got all right Mr Fritz got the money 216 Rs from which I gave to Fritz 130 Rs. I would have given him bisides the 30 you asked him to send you but he has no bill for 30 to send you. Tomorrow Diez and Hahnhart are coming tomorrow. the last is so thin and weak that he must have a change, he learns too heartily or too much it seems.

Lauffer with Hanhart will go to Kodakal for some days Lauffer is still weak and wants some days of rest.

Mr F<ritz>* is rather displeased with Ob<rien>* who did not go to Coilandy on his way to Cannanore he met F near Vadagary neither did he come near Vedamootu who was quite near his way there; I am sorry he gave this offence for here people are it seems to me not much in his favour already at least F.

Now with love to all
 Yours J Gundert
