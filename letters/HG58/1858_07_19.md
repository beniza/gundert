 Calicut 19 June <Juli>1 1858

Dear Papa

Already the 19th how fast the time passes 6 weeks more and you are with us D.V. Thanks for yours of the 15. I have as yet never heard a word from Mrs H.<odges>* as if she would <not>* have wished her niece <Harriet>* to stay here, the contrary he is much in want of her for his wunting2 for she does all for him. And Mrs. seems to be very fond of her. He is the whole day in his office and works hard it appears! Mr. Fritz undecided where to go, to Cannanore or to Paulgh he waits for an answer from Hebich who is anxious to begin his journey to Madras. Yesterday in a conversation with the Hodges he said that if the Comity (in case you reenter the mission) would place you here, he would go about traveling more and you woul care for the meetings which he intends to begin when you return Keep this for yourself. Irion has written to him that he is the finest man in the mision. He is as many easily flatered or touched by flatery! If the Bible is to be introduced in the schools as it appears by some papers You may have a fine work in your present vocation. Well the Lord will make all right where to be what to do! Have you much to do with the schools now? As you have no one acting for you, you are still troubled* I suppose. Our visitors and Convert who went to hear the Chaplain yesterday were rather disapointed after having been pleased the first time they went. With love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
