My sweet dear Frederic

Last month I wrote to you three a few lines and told you of dear papa's illness from Cochin where we had been obliged to go for his health. We have now returned by ship and were four days on sea; though a ship is much finer and more convenient to navigate than a Patimar I did not like it, however it was the only way for dear papa and by Gods grace it has done him good on the 4th day of our voyage he began to improve a little till that he had been very poorly and weak. two days ago we reached here.

Last night papa had a good rest and quiet sleep which he had not had for many weeks so to day he has felt refreshed and stronger. Praise and glory to God for his tender mercies, in making dear papa well. He dreamed that he had gone home and saw you very distinctly. Your face was shining for joy at seing your dear papa once more: I hope dear sweet boys the Lord will grant you the joy to see him in Bale one day! For the present as soon as he can bear the journey he shall D.V. go to the hills where he was with you 9 years ago do you remember perhaps Kaity or Coonoor to the last place papa is ordered to go for some monthes. We trust it will please the Lord to restore him fully to health. My sweet dear pets we think often of you all and pray that you may soon love the dear Saviour who loves you more than we, though we love you very much.

Papa sends plenty kisses to his three sons and mama sends many too  J. Gundert
