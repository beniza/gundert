Dear Marie.

Only a little bit for remembrance sake - time I have hardly left for this last post from Palgh. You make me ashamed of myself with saying you came often in my room with hopes I would begin - I did not feel so, and you know the 2 or 3 times you came and allowed of a word you always remained silent. Now I do not like to force myself as Father Confessor upon any man, and as I trust in God's own work, I did not think I had to be too anxious about you, and left off anzubohren. It is indeed not necessary that you should feel so contrite. Mama has long been jumping from joy when the Lord first visited her. The feeling of compunction came after wards - and plenty of it 
Mr. Hebich will probably soon come to Palgh when you may have a fine opportunity to tell him all and may God bless you in it. Have you also tried - to make up before going to bed - whatever queer thing has come between you and another during the day? It is a good thing to look to it and be quick about doing what is right. Now grace be with you.
 Your father
