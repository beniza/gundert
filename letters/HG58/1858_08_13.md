My dear wife

This is my father's birthday which I have always remembered more than any other day of commemoration. - Wednesday evening the Whiteh. came as we were in the meeting; they sat on my sopha when I reentered my room, ate and slept here took also dinner yesterday with us and then repaired to the Bungalow. Hoch was at Ooty so that there was room to accommodate them. I have 2ce walked with him or them to the Bung and found it very hot in the middle of the day. Yesterday evening we drank tea at the Groves, and there met Mrs Coffin etc Nothing remarkable to report. Some say that Halliday will be appointed to Coorg, which I doubt. Gompertz the paymaster will have to join his regiment, as he is now real Major. Miss Gomp up here still a bigotted Jewess. She saw me once and Ooty and remembered her stay with the Harris'. - Tom Stanes was talking with the Dr about my sermon both agree in disagreeing with it. - Tomorrow I hope to visit Plebst once more. He has largely profited by his visit to the hills and goes now to Bangalore with fresh courage. Hebich is invited up here and will get money to come and to go Harkness has begged him. I wonder if he will come

 Now farewell
 Yours HGdt

The Major Walker who jilted Emma Gr. has been sent home for hiding himself in action. I hear that he was twice engaged to marry and every time broke it off in a strange manner. Perhaps a monomania.
