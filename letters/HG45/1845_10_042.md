My dear Brother <Hebich>*

Here a few letters! But nothing from Basle. One from Miss Bailey to my wife is left here, as I expect her some time this day. Mrs Mc Alpin's daughter, Mrs Garrard, died after her first confinement, a few days before Mc Alpin's firstborn died at Aden. - We walked it very well, found the bandy in its place and reached the good part of the road safely: but then what a rain straight into our faces. All wet through, the boys shivering so I made them run in the rain this side of the river; and the dinner schmeckte accordingly. All well this morning. Hermann cried again for Mama. If she has not left many Selams und schönen Dank für alle Deine Liebe
 Dein HGdt
