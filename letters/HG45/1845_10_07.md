My dear Weib

We arrived safely at home: the boys tired till they saw at last the bandy but in good humour. Here I found all well Maria says again
- and wanted also to write, but not all is done in such a hurry. - I hope your nerves have given you some respite and the Good Lord Some strength to go through the day and be thankful for it in the evening. - The Mail says that the German Catholic Church business is going on rapidly, its spirit more and more decidedly against the truth. In Leipzig they sang in a revolt "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" and "Ein freyes Leben f√ºhren wir" - red... the Brother of the King of Saxony for his Rom Catholicism ... were only to be driven back by the military. 9 persons killed. The Stutgard Catholic Church also is divided. - What an ado for nothing. But the world will have it thus. - In the mean while let us thank that we are of the few taken out of this turmoil, who know to spend time and life and gifts for a better purpose. May the Lord accept our offerings of praise poor though they be. - With kind love from all and my heart's wish that you be quiet and let the Lord act.
