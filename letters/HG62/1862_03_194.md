 <Calw 19. March 62>*
Dear Sons

It is a long time since I wrote you, but I know that papa does it diligently Your dear letters give me always much pleasure. Still a few months and we shall D. V. have the joy to see you here. I long for it and I trust Marie will also enjoy you more than last year. She is just now in Stutgard, her letters are nice and we trust the Lord is working in her heart. 
Frederic is pretty nice works very hard perhaps at time too hard for his weak nerves but he will have it so, Paul and David are going on better with each other than formerly, we have seldom querelles. Still I fancy Paul is some what prouder, he is easily offended, then shows his dignity on his countenance for hours or days together, Sits very stiff without speaking a single word and as red as a peacock when one asks him what is the matter, he turns proudly his head on his shoulders without a word; beside this he is a nice good boy very lovely. David is less child like than P. he is too forward and fancis himself so clever, so wise one dares scarsly make him a remark so proud he is. I fear for him for he is bold puts himself in every thing, and fancies himself able to judge of every thing. I hope the Lord is preparing both of you for his work emptying you from self and filling you with His fulness, less than <for want of>* this we are poor and unfit instruments.

Adieu my very dear sons
 your Mama J. Gundert
