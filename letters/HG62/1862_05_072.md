Dear Papa

To day you are I trust in London and can rest a little from the fatigue of the journey. We are much with you in mind and in our conversations papa is oft spoken of.

Tante came, till she arrived and even since letter writing is the work of Herman, one daily to Samuel to whom else I do not know. I fear the Adieu or farewel will not be much <more>* tender than with you. Tante feel aslso that it is not right with him. God alone can reach his heart and discover to him what is wrong. but heavier things must still come upon him. before he gives up the prideful idia that he know all and can do all. 
We are all as usual Frederic rather tender and aimabel. Ernst wrote me a very kind nice note full of sympathy and invitation for the two young ones. Yette wrote me too very affectionatly and full of feelings and wishes for Herman. I do not write more for this time, we will just iron Herman's shirts.

Dr Bardth is as usual: Weitbrech exceedingly kind to Herman he gave him books as present Ps. explanations

Adieu dear Papa love to all the friends
 yours
 Julie Dubois
