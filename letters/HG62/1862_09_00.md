 [Sept. 1862]

<Rickele Deuschle, per adr. Bergmanns Wwe (jetzt Feyler) (heißt aber blos das Geschäft), auf dem Ilgenplatz>*

Dear Marie if you could see this girl of which you have here the address I would be thankful to you, tell her from me love and I do not write her because I cannot write german, inquire much after her health, my love also to Madele in Diakoniss Anstalt. If you could write English instead of German at least that which may interest me I would be glad otherwise I know little what you write as one has not always time to read me the letters, or I am not there when they come and one forgets. I went to the Wöhrle and thanked for their present my love to all the dear people here all is going on as usual with love yours afftly
