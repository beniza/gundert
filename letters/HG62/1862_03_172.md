Dear Marie

Many thanks for your kind letter and all the news. I am now very well again I have visited the Wehrles they are all well, Marie Weitbrecht has visited us to day and gave us news of you, As Mama invites you to stay till papa comes to Stutgart you might well stay to return with papa. You might then go longer to the sewing You told me that here some girls went even 20 days to learn; so if you would do the same or at least some days more it might be of a great use to you at least as long the dear tantele goes herself I am sorry to hear she was kept at home being unwell and trust she will soon be quite well.

As I must write this at night and mine eyes are weak I will not write more but say love to you dear Marie and love to all the dear people with you My thanks to dear Mama and tante for their kindness and love to you. 
Papa spends the evening with the Wirzes She is very much as usual, some good days and again ill.

With us it goes as usual Frederic very dark and cross, Paul and David good to each others and dilligent at learning

Yesterday I went with papa to Alzenberg to the meeting it was nice about Jesus washing the disciples feet I like to hear the paysants speaking and praying

Adieu dear child love to all yours affectly
 Julie Gundert
