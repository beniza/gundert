Miss H. Enßlin.

 Calw 16th August 1862
My dearest Jette

I was much grieved to hear of the illness of your dear Mother and wish I could help you to nurse her, I feel for you my beloved how hard and painful it must be for both; but I doubt not that at the same time you feel the nearness of the Lord and His help, His consolations which He usually multiplies to those who are called to suffer. May He be constantly by you and make that the affliction may appear to you very light compared to the weight of Glory which awaits you both.

I trust my husband will bring me better news of dear tantes health I am much with you in the spirit and if we who love one another so imperfectly feel and suffer for each other how must it be with the Lord whose love is pure and constant. He has taken and takes still our pains et grieves He suffers still with us and will make us partakers of His holiness through suffrings Be of good cheer of good courage His tender love is inexhaustable May you have grace to say amen with thanks and praise. My sincere love to your dear Mama with best wishes for her recovery.

Miss Faber who was here yesterday fells very sorry for you and begged to be kindly rememberd to you both. She is a fine soul, she remains with her sister Dreiß and teaches the children I have invited her to our Mission Verrein.

 Adieu my beloved friends
 Yours J. Gundert.
