My dear children [Hermann]

I had hoped that by this time some thing would have been decided about your coming; but it is still suspended; however I have some hopes that the Lord will carry it on and make an end to that waiting for you and for us and that you shall sleep quietly and happy. When the Lord has brought it to pass we shall have no doubt that His will has been done inspite of much oposition. and my losung or text which I drow in thinking of you shall be true Micha 2-13 VI Le destructeur des obstacles montera devant eux; ils renverseront tout et passeront outre; In all cases we wait upon the Lord and shall have grace to praise Him. When I looked at papa after the Gentlemen had gone who had put obstacles to your coming I felt comforted for him by the words of God saying to Abraham "I am thy great reward" from men there is but ingratitude but the Lord is our reward and he shall help papa, though it is painful, Helfer Hairing has written such a nice note to papa as if he would comfort him feeling the injustice of others

We will try to keep quiet in the Lord without evil feelings towards others And in our good Lords peace and rest, sleep well.

I am sorry for you but the long lesson of patience has provoqued many prayers which shall be unsewerd and we shall have the profit of the traial. I felt some time the proverb to be true l'espoir dif‚r‚ fait languir le coeur

Now in Jesus hope shall not be confounded, in Him we are and live. Give a hearty kiss to my dear Tine and your four daughters; may they all be prophetess like Phillips daughters Uranie sends you much love

Davids Wille has been very ill with fever and diarhea; is now etvas better Poor young paar were very anxious about dear boy

 Yours affectly JG.
