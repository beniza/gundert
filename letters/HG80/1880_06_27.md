Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, WÃ¼rtemberg

 27. <Basel 27 VI 80>1

Yesterday arrived well, abt 2, put Ur. into the waggon for Bgdf and came to the MH with Jet. She lives close to me in a room where already 2 little beds wait for their occupants, but no telegr as yet from Genua. Others say, that repeatedly the steamers took 26 and even 28 days fr. Bomb. to Gen. What can we do but wait! Saw then Pauline with Willy who arranged a Willkommen within a fine Kranz for the reception of the sister from St. (They arrived after 7). P. not worse than in Febr. Then I went to the girl's Home where the Wengers were solemnly introduced by diffrt speeches with singing and prayer. Emma and Emilie who had met me in the street accompanied me there; as for Jet I hardly see her, she finds her way by herself to Miss Buser and others, has today heard Pf. Ecklin along with Emma and Em, and visited then the Museum. I was at Pfleid's, saw also Mrs. Kaund. who is not over well. Today I had a short visit of Dav and Mar, and the evening is to be spent at Pf. Preisw's. Emil and Emm seem pleased with their journeyings, met everywhere kind souls. Some ask after you others after Hesses. Goodbye for the present

 Yrs affly HG.
