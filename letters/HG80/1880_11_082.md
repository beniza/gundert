My dear Children [Hermann]

We were glad to hear that you are all well; but I am specially glad dear Herman to see that you are happy and glad to remain in America, I regrette to have in part helped to make you uneasy about coming to us, I had not understood that you like to be in America; but thought the contrary that you would like to be here, now that I have heard how it is I am quite contented and wish only that the Lord give you fruits of your labours in the land where you are, and trust that you can now sleep well in quietness. It is troubelsome to live in suspend, and I am really sorry for the time of anxiety and waiting you had to go through.

Give my hearty love to dear Tine to you dear daughters and accept love from Uranie and myself

 Yours afftly J. G.
