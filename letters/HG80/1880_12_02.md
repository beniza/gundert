 Bath* 2 Dec 80
Very dear Br.

Many thanks for all the trouble you have taken to explain to me the German and Jewish question. I have not yet mastered your letter, having my John Bulinsk* propensity* to dislike trouble, and just now I am in some confusion endeavouring to start* our poor sick sister in law for her home. Pray for us as I know you will - as St James tells in faith not wavering - and the prayer of ... shall save the sick - also for dear Nesbite - I write in this hurry to send on an interesting dispatch from Kaity. What hath God wrought* we may indeed say

We* ourselves are well thank God.

Yours most affcly
 H Stokes
