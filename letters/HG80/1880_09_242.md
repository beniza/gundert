Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, WÃ¼rtemberg

 <Cormondreche 24 IX 80>1
My dear

Here I am at Cormondr. (4.30) having met Ur. on the way with Mme D. le cher cousin havg come to the station Auv. pour me recevoir. We have the idea of going tomorrow to B and stay a few days before we turn homewards. So then U. is well enough and we can travel together, Monday I suppose to Calw for 6 in the evening. Tell Eddy, that after all I sent his letter to Mr E. off this morning, not that it expressed just my thoughts but I fancied at last it would show confidence of some sort. Dear Ad. I hope is going on better and better. I confess I long somewhat after the children. There are none at B. except Henri who has already his 16 years and is an accomplished student of the gymnase. Goodbye for the present. U veut bien saluer et t'embrasse  avec ton H

Love to all.
