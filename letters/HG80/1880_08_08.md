My dear Children [Hermann]

At last came the good news of a dear daughter having appeared; She is as wellcome as a Samuel; The Lord gives us what is right, So may He be praised for His gift: may He the giver and you dear parents have joy through the dear Baby whom we love and imbrace in spirit till we be permitted to do it with our arms if the Lord grants this favour, We hope that dear Mama and baby are well, the Lord who has helped her in all her fears and anguish may fill her mouth and heart with praise and increase her faith and confidence. I send her my best love and a hearty kiss.

and to dear Julia we rejoice for her that she has been choosed as teacher. May the Lord keep her humble and thankful in her work and preserve her from the seduction of the world and all the vain glory and inchantements with which it seduces young people; forgetting that the love of the world is enimety against God. Marie and Emma will of cource help their mama in caring for the sweet baby.

Our little Agnes is a fine child, no one in the house is her so dear as papa Gu* above her mother, she lets papa no rest when she can catch him; at the meals she will be on his laps, Now Adieu my dear children a hearty kiss and best wishes to my dear Tine Love to all each of the children a kiss. 
I forgot last monday to give this note to papa for you so it is 8 days after

Adieu my beloved yurs affectionate
 JG.
