Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, Würtemberg

 17 IX 801
My dear

Here I am at Heinr'sbad, left 7.10 at Bale and passed by way of Zürich without entering the place. I regret not having found any more the letter which John wrote to the Antist. (Fred may perhaps have taken it back) it was no more with us when he left. But it does not matter. I dined with W. E. and told him that the whole was still problematical, tho' Sch. indeed wished to finish the story. But he has nothing more to say. Was with Kzl who shows the same interest but had not been present during the last consultation. Pauline rather strong yesterday, made her own coffee of which I also drank. Sat yet in the evening with others around Sch. for the last time. I suppose Tuesday Staefa Wednesday Berth. Good bye for the present, hope Fred arrived safely
