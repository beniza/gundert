Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, Würtemberg

 <Herisau 19 IX 80>1
My dear

You may write to Ur. that I hope to reach Bgdf on Wednesday and am at her service any day of this week or Monday following. I shall write tomorrow to Mrs Mau. that I intend coming there. Here we had today la CŠne. Miss K seems much better and ventures perhaps to go tomorrow. Thanks to J for his names Mlle Lud. I found with M and v. Baumg. who all salute most heartily, the latter thankg that you even intended to write. But Johnny dear do you know that you and Feddy have made a mistake about the Kündigung. That did not refer to MM or Verl. V, but to the printer (if change for Jany, he must be informed now; and the word K. slipped in Feddy's ear from Reinh to V.V. No, for us there was no termin mentioned, but only that the gentlemen thought Kündbarkeit a very essential condition). I hope Ad is really better and continues so that I may hope to find her out of bed. But I am also ready to sit an hour with her and tell her of the Saentis which H Mglg ascended, or of Hanna Mannfld, born in Afr who is here with her father. Other children there are also but they donot come near. If I can I shall salute also Mr W. Goodbye for the present Love to all from your ____________
