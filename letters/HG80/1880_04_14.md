Hoffe Willy und Mama sind wohl

I must today go to Stammh. But I could at least let you know that Wisiaviso (od Idisiaviso) is the correct reading, although in my young days Idistaviso was commenly received, and explained as the answer of a Saxon to a Roman soldier that asked after the name of the valley, saying: It ista wisa. But at that time there was no etymology. Now one knows that Idesi means hehre Frauen; also Frauenwiese. Half knowledge is a dangerous thing Goodbye with kiss
