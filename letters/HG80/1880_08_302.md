My dear children [Hermann]

Since Elisabeth is here with her Children the desire to see yours is increasing; and dear Tine how one would like to see her with her baby; perhaps we may have this joy next year if we live still. When a birthday or Christmas come I think of yours to whom one can give nothing; Papa will send you 100 Fcs with which you shall buy something for your dear children specially for the dear Christianele. We were very glad to hear that dear Tine is so well and can again do her work, it is good that Mariele can help her, and likes to do it Emma of course will take part in it, with a baby there is a gread deal to do. I see it now how much to wash daily. the little Agnes is a fine child Herman less aimiable; the Mama is too weak with him, he has now the measel, one can not approch him so cross he is. I wish dear Julia joy in her school, and joy with her sisters.

 With a good kiss to each of you
 Yours affectly J.G.
