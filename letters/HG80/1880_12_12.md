My dear Children [Hermann]

I will not let this year pass with out writing you a few lines, My last note you will have recieved in which you see that I am perfectly contented of your remaining in America where you wish to be; May the Lord make you faithful so that at last you may say after Paul "I am clean of the blood of you all." speaking the word in season and out of season, that the souls of all those you have to do with be so dear unto you that you cannot; but tell them the truth as it is in Jesus, It is difficult in our time for a Minister to tell faithfully to the people how they stand whether converted or not, most of the ministers are themselves still in dark so they cannot help others to know themselves, and those who know the Lord are not so zelous and free that they with out regard of personnes speak Wher are a Steinhofer a Hoffacker, an Hebich after whose preaching the hearers; may juge themselves to which part they belong, I think our ministers in general are guilty of the worldliness and spiritual death of the people I should say we all old Christians are more or less guilty, I feel so unfaithful and disobidient and hear the same complaints from many, Is the Lords arm shortened, His ears become heavy? is it no more time to take of His fulness grace for grace, Oh may the Lord give true repentance and faith to His poor children.

I was glad to hear that dear Tine is so well with her children I wish her the blessing of the Lord with a happy new year the same to your dear daughters et yourself Love from Uranie

 Yours affectionate JG.
