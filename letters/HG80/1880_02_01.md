My dear Children [Hermann]

In your last letters you speak of dear Tine as being less well, I am very sorry to hear it; but there is perhaps a cause in which case I would rejoice if it ended with an addition to the family. Any how we remember her before the Lord, and send her our true sympathy. I speak often of her with my sister and thank our Lord to have given you a so worthy companion I send her a warm kiss, I am glad to hear that you have <(seit 2. Jan 1880)>* a piano of your own, and wish joy to the dear children.

As for you I regret that you shall have the trouble of bulding a church and if it could be postponed I would be glad on your account.

May our Lord give you living members in your congregation who look more to the inward than to the outward. All that which you tell us interest us much of your family and congregation; God has rewarded your patience and perseverence amongst your people. May you have grace to proclaim the love of Christ it is a great priviledge to be called to preach in His name, the time is short therefore be dilligent, I have great joy to hear papa, with him it is, work as long as it is day!

Much love from Uranie and from me with many kisses
 Yours affectionate JG.
