Dear F.

Arrived here 5.20 after having dined with the dear Hess. Now as to your letter to E. I do not see cause sufficient for sending it. I am agst Kdbrkt2, i.e. I wish that the change if effected be complete. Therefore I have not mentioned it in the paper drawn up for Sch. I mentioned the 3000 instd of 4000 and fancy Kzl understood me fully and intended to stand up for our view. If they add some thg abt Kdbrkt I can enter upon a correspdce on the subject but do not see that we have to commence talkg abt it. Dear J seems to doubt as to what my views are, but I think they are so far plain. I can wait quietly to hear what is resolved, and if there is a wish to meet us halfway we shall do the same. Nat. Fr. etc very nice; I have no intention of going to B to influence the decision, Sch thanked me that I was short in my speeches on the subject lest it appear as if we had forced the matter thro'. Thankful that Ad is better With love from Mrs M to Mama etc  Yr P.
