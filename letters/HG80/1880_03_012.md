Herrn Dr H Mögling in Eßlingen

 <1 Marz 1880.>*

Your card arrived Saturday night. I had ...1 written to Mrs Bl the day I received her telegramm. ...1d my remaining at home. But I am better, ...1 Thursday came the Isbg sisters with whom ...1t out to see the Logis offered to them. It was her first walk and gave her inflammation of the windpipe, so she lies still, but with diminished fever. The little one is looking up. Today <1 März>* her 2d large ________ was opened and a mass of matter came out, she did not cry when it was done, but seemed almost suddenly relieved. Fancy the inflammation in the bronchia emptying itself behind in the thighs! At Hirsau yesterday I related of Bl. since I made his acquaintance Nov 29; and what I knew of God's dealings with him. Many hereabout feel his loss deeply. Goodbye
 Yours affly
