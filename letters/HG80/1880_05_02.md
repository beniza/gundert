My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your letters which are always a pleasure to us, this last seems to give an answer to my question whether dear Tini was expecting a baby is it in July? we rejoice for you of the prospect, Dear Tine how glad we would be to see her with her children I have not lost all hopes. 
Uranie who likes to hear your letters sends you much love, Your Julie will also be glad when schooling be over, She does not like ironing; it is true that it is troublesome, I am glad I have none myself we give all our wash to a washing woman who brings it ready to be put in the almira, I avoid all fatigue, and am thank God very nicely; only mine eyes are very weak, still I can mend our things, only read I cannot except one chapter in my large print new testament; but I am happy in the Lord and thankful for so many mercis I injoye.

Much love to my dear Tini to your three beloved daughters, with hearty kiss to them and to you
 Yours affectly JG.
