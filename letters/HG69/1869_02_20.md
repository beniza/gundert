<N 7.>* Calw 20th February /69

Dearest Frederic.

Today came your letter of the 13th January, so that we have been three weeks without news from you, We were not anxious. About your shirts I have written you I think, that you should keep two dozen without using them that is have them washed; but no canji or sterke in them not ironed in that way they will not become yellow nor spoil, and when the one 12 in use are too old, then you let an other 12 be starched perhaps also wash if they are not quite nice and put them on. Do the same of all your things I did always so in India for us all. Dear sweet son my heimweh is not yet forbei; and I thank God that you are well, were it not so I would feel very anxious, I am glad that you have as much milk as you want, let also your cook make you pudding instead of curry,

Louise Klein is ill since 12 days she sends you Salam, Louise Maurus cooks in her stead, and I sew the things of L.M who is to marry in Georgiie; but the old Schnürle is not yet reconsiled, jammers still about monney. I told you in my last about Bühl at his burial Helfer told the truth, that offended many specially the feuerwehr, they left the place as the Helfer was still speaking his parents were offended too and said how many peopel has he killed that one treats him so Now the old mother is dying too of the same illness as her son. We have much sickness in Calw, many die 
Your second letter comes 21 with one of Marie

Keep on reading and praying, walk with God He shall lead you and keep you from all evil Adieu dear son, with a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
