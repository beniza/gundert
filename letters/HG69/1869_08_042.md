My dear Children

It is a pretty long time since we heard of you I trust that you are all well, you have perhaps much to do as we have too just now, wash gardning, many visites which beside the joy they make part of them steal the time away, so that we say after Dr Barth friends procure two joys, one when they come and one when they go away <and the third when they do not come at all!>1 poor papa is often disturbed; but it is the season in the year just now, the vacance in Bale brings us several pupills, besides many other friends.

We look anxiously for farther news about Mary and her family, we have to accept it from the Lord and humbel ourselves,

How is dear Christina? your two dear girls will come often in our mind when the boys be here, theodor seams to be a wild fellow, a noisy boy at least our good tantele Plebst found him so <Febr 1869 in Bombay>*. I wish you joy with your two girls, for mama they are already a help at least Julie, I send them as well as to yourself and dear Tinne a tender kiss  yours J.G.
