 Calw 15th June 1869
Dearest Frederic

Again good news from you through Samuel for which thanks, now the hot season is over; apropos take care when you bathe in the sea or in the river big waves and Alligators are there.

Emelie Muller is with us, she is a fine soul, a real pearl. I rejoiece that you get such an excellent house mama. This saturday are Buhl, Ansel with two others going to Bremen. I am rather glad that B. has not been sent to India. Ansel will have to learn to bear under him; his great joy to go to Africa may soon be coolled, one of his sisters who comes to Hirsaus meetings told me that he can scarcely wait for the time to depart from London, I fear for him.

Next saterday we expet here the dear Plebsts who 8 days afterward intend to go to Bale with papa. It is raining and cold therefore the Bourkarts have not yet come to go to their solitude in Alsenberg

Frederic Muller was here, he reported that Peregrina was not going to England as yet, having no companion for the journey and he cannot fetch her, the time must appear long to her I pity her and her mother,

Yesterday 15th Samuel Gundert in Olgast got a sister; all full of joy to hear crying a girl. Samul is a very fine child, good and intelligent, "fromm" too "wers glaubt"! Our friends Wei√ü went away sooner than we expected, on account of Anna, they were both nice.

May the Lord bless you and keep you, my love to all who remember us black and white Mrs Pfleid
 Adieu yours J.G.
