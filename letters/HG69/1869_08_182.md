1Dear Children

This time I have but a few minutes, having been in Altburg it has become late, In your last you gave very little news of your daughters I fancy. In the next room are two small beds prepared for Theodor and Charl Isenberg, one shall surely talk much of Julie and Marie looking at their pictures and wishing them here too. Likely they will not be abel to spent the winter here as it is too cold for Charles complaint. Poor Marie will have had a troubelsome voyage with so young a child. We shall soon hear all about it. 
I beg for an other time more news about your daughters to whom as to their Mama I send a tender kiss
 Adieu dear son
