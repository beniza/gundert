 Calw 9th March 1869
Dearest Frederic

Again a good letter from you, you say nothing of the heat in it, so I trust that you can bear it pretty well. We thought also you would not go to Bombay, as you are so short a time in India, and who knows how soon our dear Isenberg may be obliged to make a journey voyage by sea and so see you at Mangalore

The plan of your house looks grandieus we can represente our selves well where you are, the second stage will be cooler than the first. have you still so many mise or rats, the dog should drive them away if you have no cat

From David we have just heard that he is well and seams to be joyful and happy, I hope the Lord will make him his own.

Charl Weigle is with us for a few days, he came to get work here with our Gerbers; but there are none who can imploye him, as his branch is different from that which one has here. He is I think quite glad to rest a while; he has not many thoughts about his living. We expect here Gustave Weiss with his wife, both as well as the whole house repent and seam to be really humbeld under the weight of their sins, I am anxious to hear how you bear the hot season, can you sleep at night have you a cool pillow? try to keep as quiet, calm as possibel, agitation is already provoqued by the heat one must avoid inward heat if possibel Live with the Lord and your communication with others will be tolerabel and well every day more; less to do with men; and much with God, with Him is our surety peace and joy what ever may come, Our daily mistakes and sins must humbel us and we get free of them in confessing them, the devil does not like that our pride also not; but die we must and the Lord lives in us, yea let Him live and rule in you all shall go well body and soul.

Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.

it is as cold as in January, our windows frosen
