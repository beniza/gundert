My dear Children

In the distance you learn patiently to get news about our dear sick peopel, Charles may soon be taken away.

Our Paul works as a Carpenter, but you may imagine how! he never had any tact nor sense for handy work, formerly we used to say that boy is but fit to studdy, and now learn to be a carpenter his master say he will never be a man of business, which I trust too, besides he is very short sighted which is a great hinderance. Our Lord shall make him a fisher of men I trust, here or elsewhere

Yesterday we got the news that dear Henriette has gone <9. Novbr 1869>* to her rest, she has mourned long for her poor son <Fritz Villinger>*, who has never written to her since years, her end was full of peace and joy. So my dear Uranie is quite alone I wish she would come to us.

That our dear Frederic is also not well will grieve you as well as us, the Lord be praised that we have the priviledge to put all our cares on Him who cares for us. The time is short it is my comfort, the Lord is at the door. 
Much love and kisses to my dear Christina to your two pets and yourself,  Yours J.G.
