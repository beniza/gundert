Dearest Marie

By your last we see that dear Ch. has been again unwell; he must take great care of his health, such illness is for India one of the worst; may God give you wisdome that you know how to walk.

Pauline Summer has just been here half an hour on her way to Wildberg, she returns in a few days and shall spend a few days here and Newhenkstat, her sister has a baby 3 month old, she is much better then she was, helps in the cooking and in the house.

We are just cleaning Louises feathers for her beds, it is a bad business and so longweiling; one does not know as yet when will be the marriage for the old mother Schn√ºrle is much agaist it, it may be that she will have to take a service still till the mother changes her mind or dies. 
We rejoice to hear that you had a baptisem, may God keep Jacob and make him a useful person for the work, if he is a plant planted by the father he shall grow in the Lord; the words of the Lord we are to bear in mind with every soul who comes near; the plants which my father has not planted shall be rooted out, therefore be not sanguine about people who come, are they drown by the father to the son, they shall remain. We have much to pray that our viues* and wishes about the conversion of souls be purified cleand and holy before God. Oh dear child we have much to learn that all be done in the Lord and to His glory alone.

Poor Ayah God may still drow her ones, We thank God for the one soul He has added to His church

Adieu dear Children Theodor too
 Your J.G.
