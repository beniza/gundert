 <In Mt. Clemens 17. May>*
My dear Children

In mount Clemens in the ministers house is today jubel I suppose from Julia and Marie on their papas birthday 30 years old. We are with you in thoughts and united before the Lord for giving hearty thanks for His loving kindness tender mercis to you and yours, but above all for the new life He has graciously imparted you these last years, this birth from above is the valuable one and worth. May the Lord who has began it increase it till perfection, He worketh the will and the doing, as soon as we consent to have done with self to abore it. the Lord magnifies Himself in us and through us. this grace we beg from our Lord for you in this day specially, so that the congregation commited to your charge may become a fruitful garden to God, being salt and light at least some or many if possibel among them, that you your wife and children may be in all things an exempel.

these days we have been looking for letters from you; but in vain, it is long time since we heard.

With best wishes kisses to all of you.
 Yours J.G.

Since the first of April it has been nice and warm; but to day it is so cold that one wishes for fire in the oven

With tender kisses to you all four
 yours J.G.
