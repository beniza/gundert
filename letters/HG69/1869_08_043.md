My dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your kind letter, now you have the monsoon you will soon have to take care for the land wind which is very unhealthy and shall perhaps hurt your stomach, these last weeks we had several pupills from the Mission house, we have a good deal to do just now, many visits. We long to hear about Marie and Charls, we hope that some one in Bombay will have advised them to remain longer in India and not travel in this season, at all events the Niellgherries would be better for his complaint than here, the Lord will also care for them and the journey; we can but put our cares upon Him

Louise Klein leaves us this week, she wanted to marry a young schlosser as he has no money her father does not allow her to take him, she has about 3000 fl, it is likely good for her not to be allowed to marry him for he is not nice, sits in Wirtshouse and works little, an unbeliever, The Bourkards come to us often they bath by Schnaufer both are getting better. The nevieu of Miss von Reutern Charles sends you love, they were here yesterday. 
Martha Steiger gives her parents much troubel, they are thinking to send her to America; The Lord has been exceedingly good to us in making all our children His own, it is right you wrote to Anna

Mama tante Emma Reiniger Plebst are in Boll Adieu dear son I wish you peace and joy in God

 with a tender kiss
