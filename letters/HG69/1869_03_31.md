Dear Children

I am no so good a mother as you think no a poor sinner who has been found by the good shepherd, she has given and gives still much troubel to Him and can, but wonder at His long suffring and patience. Dear son have you not a photo where papa and myself sit together? it is the only one we have and it is very good almost too good for me. The feeling you had about me formerly I had too as a child regarding my own mother and even after having known the Lord, afterward I felt how foolish, how empty I was; for she was a very upright and rightious woman who cared not for appearence, nor for any thing of the world, worked very hard to bring up her family, her only wish was that her children be not just pietist, but "fromm", at last she became also a pietist, after she had had troubel to understand those of her children who had been converted.

Paul is with us it is a great joy to see and hear him, he looses no time, study, or speak of his Lord, David is going on better too I trust the visit of Paul will do him good, I have just met a woman sister in Jesus she wept telling me "you are a happy mother, but I pray since very long and still my children grieve me hard, they are without God." Many could say like her regarding their family, and why not ourselves? because grace has abounded pure grace, therefore to God be praise and Glory, we know that we have to do with Him, a living God, we have experienced the truth of His word, abide in me then ask what you will it shall be given to you, may we learn what is that abide in Him

Much love and kisses to Julia Marie papa and Mama from Yours affectly  JG
