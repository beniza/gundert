My dear Children

We have in Calw much sickness among the children measles. I am glad that Theodor is in Stutgart, however the small pox is raging there which is much worse than the measels, by the letters of Marie you see that they have a hard time; but the Lord sustains them wonderfully.

I feel much grieved abt my dear Frederic so helpless, so easily cast down and dejected, poor dear boy. I wish he be here already, A part of the great burden and sorrow is somewhat removed about our dear Paul who shall again studdy at least it seams so when? we do not know; but it is good for his health to continue some time longer as Carpenter,

We are in winter I trust that our dear Christine does not suffer from it. In Stutgart they had such good news of you through Mr Warth that I wish I had seen him to hear all about you, but I trust we may once see you all here, it would indeed be a very great joy. I thank dear Christine for taking such good cares of you she must be a capital house keeper, the Lord has given you a pearle; thats a rare thing, May the Lord preserve her to you and bless her with her two pets and papa

With tender kisses
 yours affectly
