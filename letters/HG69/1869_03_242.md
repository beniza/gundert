Dear Children

Though we have not heard from you since we wrote, papa says one will write; for you have very likely much to do, or there is a delay in the post, 
Saturday 21 we went to Stutgart had much joy to see our dear Plebsts and hear all about our dear ones in India, papa tells you all about them I dare say so I need not repeat or spoil that which has been said. of your two girls one would not say as of Theodor he is a willder bub, his mama lets him too much liberty and freedom etc No your daughters behave well I am sure and would be ashamed of their cousins, however all the Gunderts have been like Theodor except Paul who was always rather quiet but selfish and proud, We expect him to day from Tubingen. David is better bodily and spiritually looks chearful and hapier than formerly. In Stutgart they asked much after you all, they would like I think to get a letter for them selves from you. Mama and tante specially! In olga street they are well and happy, we have lodged there by Caroline, Anna expects a second child. I hope to hear good accounts of you all and with a tender kiss to papa Mama Julia and Marie I remain yours
 J.G.
