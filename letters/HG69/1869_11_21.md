My dearest Frederic

Just now has come yours from Oct after your return. Many thanks for all the news about the stations. We rejoice greatly to hear about all the dear peopel who wish to be baptised may God still increase the number and make them true and living members of His church.

According to the news of your health you may soon return to us which would be better than to wait too long there where the climate is so injurious for you. May God keep you from doubtes and temptations, you did not go there without having prayed and if it was a mistake God shall turn it to his glory and to the profit of your own soul. Always smaller and smaller it is that which pleases the Lord, not our work and doing much, preaching teaching no, but a servant of all, one who becomes as a child shall be great in the Kingdom of our Lord that is very hard for us to be humbel to consent to be nothing, in prayer and talk it is soon done; but in reallity it is a difficult and hard thing, perfectly against our nature, to the Lord it is a small matter that in order to make us such we should make a long voyage cost much money He does not care for it; He must prepare us for His holy kingdom, May the Lord work in you that which is pleasing in His eyes through the tryal, so that with the croud in heaven we know what is that wash his cloth make them white in the blood of the Lamb Be of good chear dear son waiting on the Lord who is our redeemer. May He help you and make your way clear

 adieu yours affectly
