 Calw 15th Sept 1869
My dear Frederic

It is pretty long since I took up my pen to write to any one; for I find no time since our dear peopel are here the two children give a great deal to do, specially since the baby is unwell he cries much, we do not know what it is, Charles does not complain; but he is not well, looks poorly, does not cough much; but has a dry little cough with some blood spitting, he sleeps, but dreames much and perspire, he imagine, that he shall soon be well; and return to India, what we do not think he does not know nor believe that he is so ill as he is, After a month or as soon as it is cold they will go to Stutgart, it would be too cold here to spend the winter, This afternoon they are in Teinach with Mrs Groves and her daughter who are here since a few days, of course we had joy to see them, but our house is so full that we feel like Dr B. joy at their going away to Stutgart where they have taken a loging for some weeks. Our Paul is nice; but thinks still as before, that is, all learning of sciences except the bibel is dangerous and against Gods command, so he is unmouvabel. We can but pray. God shall guide him His will be done. The old Kiefer Giebenraht has died poor man he was seldom sober Mrs Wirz has a second little girl

 Adieu dear Son
 yours affectly JG
