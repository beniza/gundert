 Calw 28th Dec 1869
Dearest Frederic

You are perhaps on the way when this reaches you. We long to have you in our midst and try what may help you; of course as you are on the road we feel anxious and how glad shall we be when a Telegran announces your arrival in Europe, God who has cared for you on the steamer from Manga to Bepoor <Cananore>1 sending you friends will also care during the long journey and make it tolerabel if not agreabel, till now you have felt that the Lord was with you and has blessed you, He will continue to help.

Of late I felt heavily the trial which has been sent us, the illness of two children Paul laid still havyier than the two, and beside no servant girl; that is always some one to help for the present but no fixed girl they are so rare that one must be thankful to find one who will serve us, After having sought a long time in Calw lost all hopes to find any one on the 27 came one who had made us to wait 10 days for an ansewer, on the very same day Paul made some confession to have been unkind so papa could speak with him and he heard, which is to say much, so a step is made the Lord will work farther I have good confidence; He alone can do something, It is difficult to ascertain how far the enemy is working, what is sure is that P is the Lords and He shall care for Him.

Jettle is in Stutgart for some days, we have no direct new from Marie; Jettle comes back to morrow and we shall hear, David seams to have a new season speaks of life, love and hapiness, (he has joined the Darbyists. <d.h. die Metzgerschen halten ihre Stunden nach Art der Darbyisten)>1 
 Adieu my very dear son
 yours J.G.
