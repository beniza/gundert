My dear Children

These days your dear Children are I suppose full of joy, I am sorry that we could not help towards their joy by some little presents for Christkindle, 
Your letter dear Son has given us great joy, Your joy is the Lord He is your portion and you are His with dear tinne, and already Julia loves the Lord which is for you a great joy. Dear Mariele shall also come to Jesus and find that He is a blessed and good Lord. Of late our hearts were heavy loaded and we knew but one way to get light, by Him who has invited the heavy laden; the most painful was our Dear Paul; but behold on the 27 just 4 years after the awakening the Lord gave again some comfort, he could hear his papa and confessed he had been unkind to us and others, it is a step forward to humbling oneself, the Lord will still help farther He alone can show and convince him where he is unright and errs, I have been troubeld also about a servant woman, since 6 months we could not find any one, that is only some one for month and weeks, at last one came who shall come in licht mess

your dear Tinne would not be troubeld to be without a girl; but in our house we can not, the one we have now says that I work more than her which is true.

With hearty love and kiss to you four
 yours J.G.
