 Calw 22 June 1869
Dearest Marie,

Again no news tuesday you may imagine how we are looking for news even in the newspapers, but they have also not yet come, it is perhaps on account of the monsoon!

The dear Plebst are with us and cause us much joy, he has just had our little verein, all were pleased to hear him relating about the different customs of the hindus, they are both pretty well, leave us saturday to go to Bale with papa. our dear Emelie Muller injoye them too, the more one comes near her, the more one values and loves her, I fear a little for her health, her red lipps and cheeks are too fine,

It is so cold here that we are obliged to make fire every day, one fears for the corn as it rains much, pour peopel have not been abel to gather home their hay, it spoils on the ground. The Lord will perhaps send a famine on our land, till now we had the bread very cheap. One would like to have a pip at you, one fancys to see mama and baby happy by each other, and theodor patronising the new born as if he shoud be the keeper of it. and papa is he well enough to hear the new song at night?

We suppose that something has hapend with the Steamer, that no letter has come, We learn to wait and trust our Lord who is faithful and good. Adieu my very dear children, May the Lord watch over you with kisses  yours affectly J.G.
