 Suterday evening <ca 12/5 1869>1
Dear papa

through Conrad we had already heard of Mr R. death before this inclosed arrived.

I am thank God very well, we suppose that you may be detained longer in Stutgart on account of the burying of Mr R. <Reihlen?>*

With love to all and best wishes on your speach in Canstat
 Yours J.G.

Jettle has been very busy the whole day with wash which has got on slowly Mrs Scheffel told us that Mr Widman is already in Stutgart, went to see Mr Weigle yesterday.

I find the day terribly long because I am not permitted to work
