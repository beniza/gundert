Dearest Frederic

In your last you said nothing of Charles so that you knew not that he is ill, we wait for the next letter to hear Whether they come or can remain in Bombay which might be better for him. I feel deeply grieved about our dear Paul, papa is of course telling you all about him, how decietful is the enemy, how does he come as an engel of light. David was like him and God has helped He shall also help Paul; but poor boy has a terribel will of his own and if he takes this as being Gods will it may last a while before he gets right, this is more grievous to me than the illness of Charles and our present need of a servant girl, Louise has gone and we find no one; but God will I am sure send some one; must only learn to wait upon Him. 
Poor papa is not very well fatigue of the 3 sleepless nights in Tubingen and the heart pains about Paul. So has our God troubel with his poor children who are so often decieved by the devil. Ah it shall be nice where the devil shall no more exist and that wicked heart of ours, which is deceitful above all

 Adieu me dear son
 Yours J.G.
