Dear Children

The news about Selma have grieved us very much, the mother must have little fear of God to allow her girl so to wonder about <mit dem blinden Pezold>*, and thereby perhaps get ruined, in America peopel who will work can get their lively hood. I thank you to have interfered and kindly sent her back; perhaps the poor child would rather not work; but walk about, I suppose dear Christina is not quite pleased to get the conference in Mount Clemence, she will get much work and expenses, We are glad to hear that the evil in her hands is not so bad as formerly and trust the new remedy which you are going to try may be blessed and cure her.

Does not Marie wish also to go to school with her Julia? thats right that the last learns so quick. she shall soon keep up the correspondance with G'papa. May God keep and bless your two dear pets. their future compared with the one of Selma is peace, that is confidence in God who has given them better parents who bring them up in Gods fear, Would it not be better to put Selma in service in a christian family then to be at home? 
With hearty kisses to you four
 yours JG
