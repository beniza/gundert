My dearest Frederic

We look anxiously for news from you from Palghout. I am very often with you in my mind and feel very thankful that you are with dear Samuel and Elisa the Lord will guide you the way which are to go, Today Paul went to church because his papa went too; but he would not hear the meeting in Hirsau, he has not enough time to read his bibel the morning early till 8 oclok the evening from 5 till 10 he has for himself and the whole sunday, he is not yet right, though he has spoken as if he would return to Tubingen, I fear he is high minded and this grieves me more than anything else, 
Today monday came yours from Palghoat. Ah dearest F. we sigh for you and wish you to sit with us, the time will come and God shall help you during the journey. We are in continuel troubel with servant girl, I had hope that yet we were provided with an old one who understands her work, but she cannot continue the work is too much for her. it is very difficult to get any body who will serve, we have certainely much more troubel in this respect than we had in India, Now dear sweet son may God keep you in perfect peace and quietness
 with love yours J.G.
