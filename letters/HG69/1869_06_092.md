Dearest Marie

We have been looking anxiously for news, every newspaper is also searched to see whether a girl has been born in Hydrabad however by this time we trust that you are a happy mama we trust the Lord has done above expectation, you will have felt the heat very much the last weeks, and the nights will have been trying ones, Theodor will have thought that God gave him his Hermanle again. I am glad for him to get a companion, on which he may exerce his benevolence and love, so well as teaching I suppose.

But what is papa doing; can he bear the heat without return of diarhee and fever? we feel some what anxious about him! Mr Bourgard who has looked for a loging in Alsenberg pleased us very well and we are glad to get them so near for some month,

Caroline with Charls Wei√ü are here for some days he is very poorly, thin weak, no apetite, but in his soul he prosperes in God. he is very different from formerly. May God give you grace dearest Marie to love your children according to God, your husband too, it is very natural to us to love the gifts more than the giver, that is idolatry, against which God protests He is to be dearer to us than any thing in the world; but the knowledge of His great love to us can alone inabel us to love Him beyond all. 
Adieu dearest children love to your friends Shirt I think of her and Margaret.
 Yours J.G.
