My dearest Marie and Charles

Accept my sincere thanks for the fine capute you have kindly sent me it is indeed very pretty! As for the dress if Mrs W does not send it I would not take it as I really do not want a dress; if she has forgotten it it is all right I thank you just as if I had had it.

I send you herewith a letter of Marie Monnard.

I am glad to hear Theodor was so happy at his little things and that he did not want to eat all at once sondern said aufheben, Charl Scheffel is delighted with the soldiers you sent him. Apropos what is doing Zahn? Peregrina will be glad to get at last her children. Give my sincere love to dear Mrs Isenberg to Jetthen and Albert.

We are very anxious to hear further from Frederic. Is now your little one reconsiled for having no more milk from you, does he sleep better? 
The goodle dit not tiry me the least all went on most quietly, as a play. All the news about us you shall hear from Jettle.

With a hearty kiss
 yours J.G.


1Liebe Marie!

Will nur auch schnell Dir danken für Dein liebes Geschenk, das ich gut brauchen kann. - Dem lieben Charles und den Kleinen meinen Gruß und Kuß. 
 Es küßt Dich
 Dein Paul.
