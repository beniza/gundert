Dearest Frederic

In my last I told you something of Biel our neighbour, two days ago as the helfer Schmied would visit him he was just on the night chair his father by him finding fault with the helfers speach at his wife s burrial he the helfer wanted to go in; but the door did not open so from behind he heard all their anger against him; for his father is not much better than the son, poor man he shall not recover it appears, and no real repentance so many calls, so many means of grace all seam to be in vain.

Schnurle looks very happy as bridegroom his Louise too, she is soon to come to us to work her outfitt. the old mother is still much displeased to get a daughter in low who has so little monney, and so pietiste. she will not see Louise, great many peopel have to talk against it, the devil uses many to make the mother worse; but he is very quiet et tells Louise when peopel take to unswer nothing but keep very quiet, he has prayed a whole year about it and knows it is from God

Poor Biel <BÃ¼hl>* has now nervous fever, last night he wanted to run out was already down stair without clothes. Charles illness makes us anxious, but perhaps it is only like with you that God has in store blessings for which he prepares them, I have good confidence for you dear son, listen only to the woice of God, be obedient to the spirit and you may see and feel wonders for body, soul and spirit. Sweet dear son you are often in our thoughts and we bear you, but our Lord bears you too and He can help and bless richly, take care of yourself, against the sun, too much work, excitement and food, one can help a great deal towards ones health and peace 
10 Biel has died how owful, his peopel say he has uberstanden and think all is right because he died quietly

Adieu my dear son
 Yours J.G.
