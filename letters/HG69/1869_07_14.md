Dear Frederic

Now you have rain and injoy the cool nights I am glad for you and we are thankful to God; that you could bear the heat so well. These last days have been very nice warm just as I like. Our Louise <Klein>* is to marry if her father who till now did not like it consent to it her geschwister are for it too, so we are to look for another girl may God send us a right person. Peregrina Davidson has gone to England was recieved very friendly of her husbands family. her children delighted to see her again, she wrote a nice letter her mother in low has an incurable disease of the heart; so that one hopes it will go on better than formerly. Mrs. Isenberg would get quieter days if her daughter was happy, though there remains poor Albert who grieves her too, You would rejoice to see and hear David he is quite another man The Lord be praised, We learn to look to Him, to call and wait upon Him alone, which is a good thing, for it is not in vain. He fulfils His promises for such who wait and believe Him hope is not confounded not decieved though it may tarry even long.

May the Lord reveal Himself to you more and more, this is the case for those who love Him, as he unswered to Phillip. God be praised to have given you hunger after His word, yea feed on it and you shall get strong, 
Love to all who remember us specially Mrs Pfleid and Hanna in the poor house

 Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.
