Dearest Marie

Many thanks for your letter papa has just read it, the Lord be praised for giving you a tolerabel season with dear Charles, I wish you a blessed Christmas joy and peace in the Lord.

Much love to the whole house kisses to the dear pets. I dare say Theodor injoyes the many Christkindle to which he is invited, Our goodle are scarsly worth to be sent to the Children; for they have much better ones in Stutgart, however after the good and pretty are finished these may still be acceptabel,

We are still in troubel about a servant girl hope however the Lord will help us in time. I feel rather nervous and lowspirited so I am like Margaret Ward, it will come a better season. The days are so short that one cannot nu‚ les deux bouts comme on dit en fran‡ais, Yesterday we saw the young Wöhrles, they are very comfortabels and happy send you much love, as soon as she gets a moment free she will write to you. I shall soon visit the Mama W. and thank her for appels she has kindly sent us.

That Paul returns to Tubingen you hear from papa however he is not that which one could wish, a humbel saved sinner could do differently, however I am thankful for the step he makes towards Tub.

Adieu my very dear children, pardon that I do not know how to rejoice you niether by writing nor present

 hearty kisses from
 yours J.G.
