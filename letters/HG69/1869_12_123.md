Good evening my dear children it is already long since we heard from you, You will have been hindered to write on account of the wash and other works, we had news about you all through Mrs Schauber who came yesterday, we were glad and thankful to hear that dear Ch has a pretty good time that the two children are well, and according to Mrs Schauber's report you are well too, I trust the big wash is over at least in part and that dear mama Isenberg has not got ill from it! nor Jetthen, Ours is on the b√ºhne quite frosen, we trust however to iron Wednesday. Jettle is in Nagold for a few days, for the baptisem of Charlott K's child, I send a kiss to Theodor if he still remember me

Adieu dear children
