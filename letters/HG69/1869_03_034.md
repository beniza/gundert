 Calw 3d March 1869
My very dear Frederic

A thousand thanks for your last letters, our dear Lord who has taken care of you till now will do it farther too. though I have heimweh after you I am not anxious about you, as long as you remain humbel depending on God though with many mistakes and many up and down I fear not, the Lord carrys the lambs and the weaks on His schaulders, can you then fall does He not hold you fast Oh yes very fast and sure, you have a good shepherd I have good confidence for you only small and distrusting your self He will then glorify Himself and His holy name in you and through you. continue to be as a child who as soon he has done any thing wrong confesses it and learn thereby to be on his guarde. I wish you always hunger and thirst after the word of life then you shall be as the green trees discribed in first Ps. 3 vers.

Paul continues to feed on the word as formerly he grows by it to Gods praise David still the same I fear for him for he is a proud and selfish man.

Charl Weigle shall perhaps come in Calw to our neighbour Naschold Gerber, as gesell; We have now in Calw a machine for wash by Botzenh in phosphorik fabrick on the way to Walkm√ºhle, All the peopel go there to wash, it is much quicker and cheaper done than at home, we shall go to next time. So your shirts from Bale are not very fine I am sorry for it you should then put them on during the cool season and the finer ones in the hot season You must tell me what you may require

With a tender kiss
 your JG

Love to all who remember us
