 [Oktober 1869]
My dear Marie

We were much grieved to hear that dear Charles is so very poorly, may the Lord help you both and comfort you making the pains and uneasiness tolerabel. We are often with you in the spirit. Theodor is nice and quite well. A propos you had bought chins* for pinefore would you send it me to make them and put them on, he would then spare his nice ones and not so often wash them.

I find but one box of Cornflour

With much love to you all in the whole house
 Yours J.G.

PS. Please thank heartily dear George and Emma for the seringe it pleases me well and is cheap papa shall pay it when he comes
