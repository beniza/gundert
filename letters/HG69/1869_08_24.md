Dearest Frederic

Yesterday I was in Stutgart to see our peopel <Isenberg>* who arrived last sunday 23d they will remain in St for 8 or 10 days as it is just Mission feast. I found Charles better than I expected, when asked how he is he ansewers well. they were all well during the journey, the little Charles is a fine boy and brave sleeps much gives but little troubel, while master Theodor shows his dignity, rather willd and cares little for his mama's orders; but has respect for his father, Marie looks just the same as she did only darker <broun> from the journey, I would have liked to see dear Grandmama with the Plebsts; but they are still in Boll GrossM is very poorly one fears it may be her last illness <fÃ¼r jetzt aber besser.>1

I feel a little anxious about our peopels return; may God give them grace to walk humbly before Him, so that they give offence to no one. Marie by her dressing fine and other things in which one is not accustumd here, the world and Christians have many buts <Aber>1 against missionaries. Perhaps it may do good to Albert to have his brother near. I lodged in Olgastreet Anna is also in Boll, her little girl is very small, very thin; but healthy, she may however give some troubel as she looks very delicate. Caroline is well, the two brothers too. Charl has no work, and Adolph says not a word about giving him work, he has something sad goes every moment in his room to pray too much Caroline is a little troubeld about him 
 Adieu dear son
 yours JG
