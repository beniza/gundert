My dearest Frederic

The last week I did not write to you, having been rather occupied with cleaning because we have got a new girl on martini. I was glad to see by your letter that you are of good chear waiting upon the Lord for all that which concern you bodily and spiritually, Yea where men say unfit for the work God may say the contrary, and literally realise the words in Esaias, 40 Those who wait on the Lord get new strength so that they fly as eagels, they shall walk and not get weary run and not feel tired. If it is necessary for your soul's wellfare to be some what unwell you shall get the profit of it and all shall turn to the glory of God. some illnes can still be overcome by prayer and faith, May God teach you this secret and make you a blessed instrument for others. We are the more with you in spirit since we know you are unwell, and your being of a content spirit under the trial is a great comfort to us, may our dear Lord keep you in thanksgiving, and good hope and trust to Him who has said be careful for nothing Yes our Lord cares for you and though we sigh and are grieved about your health we live in hope that you shall still serve the Lord in India. I just get the news that dear tante Henriette has gone to her rest on the 9 Nov. she was not long ill 9 days she had joy and peace believing in the Lord
