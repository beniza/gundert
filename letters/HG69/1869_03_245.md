Dearest Marie

At last we have seen the dear Plebsts, it was a real joy to meet again and hear from eye witness all particulars about you, Charles has not given the impression to be fully restored. and he looks very miserabel, while you look better even than on your last pho, which for us represents you as when you were a girl full of life and health, of Theodor I heard from Paul Fritz that he is a wilder pursh or bub, the same witness had my children so there is room for improvement which shall come with the time surely, it is a mark of health if they are willd. As regard Charles they have not seen him before and cannot judge rightly of his looking which never promised much strength, even when well, however we will wait upon the Lord, for whom little or much strength is equal,

Accept thanks for all that which you have sent, please give my love and thanks to dear Margaret for the echarp she has kindly sent me, in the Armonium you shall find two hats one for Theodor and one for Willy, having heard that you would like to have socks as you sow to the children who came home, Emelie sends you from her verein 6 pairs I shall DV for the future knit some just as they had, that is a few rows white and a few red or pink as the woollen ones I had made; but not so very fine I can not; and they are not so strong as a little coarser, Dear Marie spend no money to send us presents, it is not good, we have things enough from India and useless things should not take your money, you want it yourselves
