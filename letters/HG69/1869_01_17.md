Dear Paul

Today papa preached in Stamheim, I remained at home, as I was this week once in Stamheim when I visited the good peopel there, both are nice, one feels that they learn under the cross to know self and God.

they have good news of their Seminaristen. they wish much to have a Vicar for he the Pfarer can no longer officiate.

I long to hear of your health You had joy to see and hear Mögling I suppose?

By big Wagner in Bishof are the eldest and youngest sons dead in one hour both died rather unexpectedly,

Again monday past without a note from you,

Tuesday a good note from you for which many thanks.

 Adieu dear son
 yours JG.
