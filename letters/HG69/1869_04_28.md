1Dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your good welcome letter. I add here a few lines only to telle you about your woollenen things You must never put them to the sun but in a cool damp place in the Keller if one has one in Marseil* one keep them so, you must wrapp all your woollen things in a sheet or tabelcloth wrapp them so well that no opening remain, put in it also Campher, and shut up your bundel in a box and put the box in a place where the sun cannot reach, the box well shut up very close no air should go in, in the same box you can put the shirts and other things which you do not put on but do not put in it one single one of the piece which has been touched by the insects els all would be eaten up, put them in a separate linen clothe or in a night shirt if you have no sheet, You can make paquet as merchant so wrapp them carefully that all be covered with white linen or shirting. I kept all our things so and had nothing spoiled except by the washerman who let them about.

Our big cleaning is over, sitzung is past, we sit a little quiet, News I give you none for other people can do it better To day is very hot and I am thinking of you if you learn to keep yourself cool with clothing, eating, bathing, one learns these things gradually, sleeping on a mat with a leather pillow, but above all a continual look on the Lord expecting all of Him health for body and soul, live with Him to His glory. recieving instruction by every mistake which we make We have to do with a good Lord 
 Adieu dear son

David has also his woollen things eaten up in Stutgart I have sent him a bag to put them in well shut up
