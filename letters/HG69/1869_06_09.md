Dearest Frederic

I have quite forgotten that it is the day of writing, by the letter of Charles <WeiÃŸ>* you will see that they are with us, Charles is very poorly very thin and weak, but nice growing in the knowlege of the Lord, Caroline is also nice and quiet, Albert has remaind at home, he is still the same; but you get news direct from Charls. Mr Bourgard is just with us seeking a lodging for him and his wife, they have found a nice one in Alsenberg. I am glad for both party, the peopel by whom they come are nice peopel; but their knowlege of God wants to be enlightened, and God will use our dear friends we trust for the purpose, We are glad to get them so near us. 
All the news are given you by others who know them better than I do. Soon Emelie Muller with her mother will come to us.

Emelie Seeger sends you love. You will have heard that David is by Gods grace again well according to body and soul. thats a great joy to us. May God prepare us all for His coming daily live as if it should be the last day on earth, that is to say much but such should we be who wait for their Lord and their redemption. My love to all who remember us with a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
