Dear Children

We have to thank again for a good letter from you and the dear Julie will by this time have got her Grandpapas answer and be very glad of it she can already begin to gather letters to her adress; Marie will not be jealous but wait till her time commes.

To day we heard from David he is it appears better and more joyeful. With us it is really cold the windows covered with flowrs as in January, peopel who have made their gardens in februar shall have to begin again. 
Charl Weigle is with us for some days, he related of your tears in Bale as you visited them in Kinderhaus In seing him I feel how much I have to thank the Lord to have so taken care of ours and given them dilligence in their work,

We are thank God all well except Catarrh, and that which winter brings to old peopel. We feel very thankful that God has spared Charl Isenberg s life. We must long wait till we hear of dear Emma s with Pl arrival in Stutgart.

With true love and hearty kisses to dear self to better half to Julia and Marie from yours affectionate
 J.G.
