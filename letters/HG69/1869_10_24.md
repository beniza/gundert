My dear Children

I have not yet thanked you for your well come note filled with good wishes on my birthday, in which also you show that the Lord Jesus has become your portion, so that you can say when the Lord Jesus who is my life shall appear I shall appear with Him in Glory. What a glorious promise is that if we suffer with Him we shall reign with Him, yet, now for a while, hope, believe suffer and then in all eternity be with Him where we shall rest and injoye.

Papa has no doubt told you all about our dear Paul who causes us great anxiety and grief, may God soon help him to see his error, it is really most painful to see him.

Lately Julia with Ernst were here, she red some of your letters and was much interested about you and yours, she feels much better than formerly, however she caughs still pretty much, She has gained a little I think by her illness. Theodor is with us I suppose that your two girls together would not take up the time as he, he is just pulling me to play with him and leaves me no rest, Your girls would help me giving me a stool instead of pulling it away as the boy does, however one loves him, but he requires a firm hand over him
