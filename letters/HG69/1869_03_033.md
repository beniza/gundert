Dearest Marie

Your letter from Bombay has caused us much joy and filled our hearts with thankfulness to God who has so far helped our dear Charles and led you safe to B, where you had the joy to see our dear Pl. we long to see them and hear all about you and your brothers etc. It is really sad to hear how missionaries are going on in Bombay, poor Mrs. Clarck may God open her eyes! You are right dear Marie rather work less and speak little or not of ones work. God must have great and long patience with such poor peopel as we are; who often spoil more than help, therefore rather have no name nor appearence,

Yesterday we ironed some of our big wash no less then 112 pocket hankerchiefs and only two from papa, tomorrow is the real ironing day. We have Martha Steiger to help during the illness of our Louise Klein who is with her parents; The Bride Louise works her out fitt. she is full of cares about making her beds and about her Fritz who is not well, his mother has not yet consented to see L. and her mother is angry too.

I fancy some time that you have gone by sea as far as Mangalore by Pattimar, that would be a joy for F who has still heimweh, the heat begins early this year with you, with us it is full of snow and rain. When do you expect an addition? May the Lord so bless the trial you had that you may praise Him first for own soul and for many others who may be His grace be brought to Him or benefitted. With tender kisses and best wishes
 yours J.G.
