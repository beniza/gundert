Dear Children

Your last letter gave me real joy, so now your happiness and joy is in the Lord Jesus who has loved you unto death to Him be praise and Glory to have revealed Himself to you, giving you in His excellente knowlege the perle of great price. We are made Kings and prists by having become children of God, what high and great privilege have we not? The promise that if we abide in Him, His word in us we may pray what we will it shall be greanted unto us. May we have more of the spirit of supplication and prayer with thanks giving. All that which you tell us of self, better half, and Julia and Marile interest us much, both are already a help for mama.

Last Sunday Krau√ü was here he remembers you well, sends you love, he is very impressionnabel, often very high; but then more often still very low some time despairing, poor young man I pity him, he has no one near to help nor advise him, he is Architect in Weilerstat, he comes now and then to us, I wish he would come more as papa might do him good. GrossMama is not well one feares it might be her last illness <(lebte noch bis 79)>*, therefore we are doubel thankful that dear Emma is with her; for none of her daughter in low could care for her, and tante Emma is not well enough to do it, I send a tender kiss to my two dear grand daughters to you both with best wishes

 yours affectly
 J.G.
