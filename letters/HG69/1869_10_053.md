Dear Marie

We were greatly grieved yesterday to hear the sad news about dear Charles health. We are glad to hear by yours of today that you had a better night and that you have an other Doctor, We shall likely try him too for Paul who has began homeopathy it seams to do him good; but his Dr has died so we must try another. About Theodor you have news from others, I am glad that you have more rest with little C since he has one tooth.

The pieces of flanell I send you have rather the flanells of C washed it is a small work to wash them rather than to make a new one

How is your new girl?

Love to all of you, with hearty kisses and best wishes for our dear patient  Yours J.G.
