Dearest Marie

Today only a few lines, as I have to keep up wood this afternoon having spent the fornoon with Eellene in the wood wher she was delighted to gether berries for papa. she is with her father here while mama with the other children are in Jacksfelt together with the Plebsts, Grandmama has less pains however not well, Adolph little Anna was baptised last sunday. We were much rejoiced and thank God for the good news about the late baptised Andrew, may the Lord keep him and make him a blessing for many. that you were not so considered or thought of in his conversion as the first Missionary is good. You learn thereby to give God all the glory, and humbel yourselves, it is Gods work and the more we look to Him and expect all from Him the more conversion shall you see, all plants which He has not planted shall be rooted out, therefore this are we to learn by every soul who comes near, and think but little of our doing or of others doing, what the Lord requires of every housefather or servant is that he be faithful; May our Lord give you this grace looking to Him alone, May He bless you and your dear children with the friends there, Adieu dear Children

 With kisses
 yours J.G.
