Dear Marie

Many thanks for all the news you gave us God be praised that dear Charles is so tolerably, and both children so well, Many thanks too for the presents of Christmas. you should not have done it.

That God has helped with Paul you have already heard, and also for a servant girl.

Papa has a catarrh, but will however come on thursday to Stuttgart and Kornthal at least we hope so. David will give you all the news about us all.

With love to you all with kisses
 yours J.G.
