Dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your good letter every sunday we look out and our good postmeister knows it so well that he sends us as soon as they arrive even the evening. it is kind of him, they ask always after you all. As we walked out in black yesterday to condulire Marie Keiser on her fathers death; they got alarmed thinking that perhaps Charles had died, as they knew he was ill, they have good news of Allex who tells them his whole heart every visit, every walk he makes, If only poor Charl W was like him though unconverted; he is honest, true, attached. Saturday we go DV to see our Plebsts and hear all about you I long to hear, though after all we shall not know much more than we do through you letters which make us always happy and thankful. You are in the school of our Lord, when you have learnt a lesson an other one is ready for you and though they be now and then a little hard they are useful and fitt us for Gods service. Be of good chear our many mistakes and sins help us to become humbel and distrust ourselves, to learn to have no confidence in the flesh nor in our own wisdome and understanding is of a great value, many suffer much for want of this knowledge, May God bless you, guide you, keep you small for your own eyes, in this way He shall use you for His holy work, Now the heat is begining take care of the sun for the liver it is very hurtful.

The Lord will keep you according to body soul and spirit my love to all those who remember us black and white with a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
