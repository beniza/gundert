My dearest Frederic

We had again good news from you the Lord be praised, till then the heat had not hurt you; but why do you change your shirts so often? when it is wet from perspiring keep it on you if you feel cold cover yourself so as to keep yourself warm, to let the shirt dry again on one's skin is to get by it the strength one has lost by the perspiration. I changed as seldom as possibel as soon as I felt wet and somewhat cold. I did put a shall on me so let it dry on me.

In the piano is one pair of socks if you find them too coarse tell me freely, I will then advise you to buy english ones made in the machine they are cheap; but soon spoilt, but however as you perspire much it will be better you put on very fine ones, never try to stop the swet of your feet it is healthy for you to perspire,

Till now you have experienced much loving kindness from the Lord, I rejoice to hear that you seek to save souls in witnessing of our Lord; may you also have joy to see some coming near. It is right for us to use the time we have it will soon be too late.

I rejoice to see David here next sunday with Paul, Frederic will be wanting, but the Lord is with him and comforts him no? yes it is so. He does beyond expectation our good Lord. Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.
