Dearest Marie

Your last with the one Charles have again caused us much joy. Our Lord be praised for the sudden and wonderful help He has let you experience such token of Him are fitt to teach us lessons which should last our whole life. you will have understood that which the Lord wanted to tell you and also learn to know Him more, Know Him believe in Him is something very great, this knowledge has made our for fathers or the saints in old testament what they were. The text of to day is Moses hielt sich an Den, den er nicht sähe, als sähe er Ihn, that is faith The Lord has long patience with us till we learn to know Him a little and get confidence in Him. I think often on these words He shall use in the great day to those who shall say we have eaten and drank at thy tabel even done miracels in thy name, I know you not, how terribel fancy al along here below that one is a Christian yea talk even fine of Him and preach, even so much faith as to do wonders, and after all not be known of Him. Oh dear Marie that's the great point not so much convert others; but be quite sure He knows me and I know Him, I have to do with Him the holy one the living God, men appear to us then very small and in their real value.

On Saturday D.V. we shall go to Stutgart to see Tantele I long to hear about you all,

I trust that dear Theodor who was not well in Bomby is now quite well, and that our dear Charles has no return of the illness, Mr Knott gave a good word to Mrs. Clarck poor woman let us dilligently know this closet in which we get strength

Adieu my beloved children, with a tender kiss to you three hearty love to dear Marga and child
 yours J.G.
