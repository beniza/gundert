 <In Mt. Clemens 27. Jan>*
Dear children

I hope you had a happy Christmas and a blessed first day of the year, and may God bless you richly during it make you dear son a blessing, a smell of life unto life for many. Giving you joy in your congregation in seeing true conversions, joy also in your own family, all the news you give of your two dear daughters and wife interest us highly. My brother wrote that he heard from you with great pleasure, they are leaving their place to go to Floridas to spent the winter, his son Francis wrote us from Paris that he would come in the spring. My brother writes that poor Fritz Fillinger is going on very badly, my poor sister is greatly grieved about him her only son who never writes to her, but she knows how he lives.

Apropos have you not got in the spring some money from my brother on our account and how much? please be so kind to tell us, as he has forgotten or I make a mistake myself. Our two younger sons have spent several days with us, both not quite well, Paul has the head somewhat affected, David has been very poorly continues to be shut up God will in His time help him out of his unbelief Many kisses to all of you wife Julia Marie papa 
 Adieu yours J.G.
