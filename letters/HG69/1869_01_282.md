My dear Paul.

To day came your little note for which many thanks, We need not your pills for Broun we have enough here for him and for you, so lately they did not work so well as before. I trust however that your head is not affected, do you also drink water and eat apfel?

May God bless you as richly in the next year as he has done the last. I wish you not only a happy birth day but a whole year, with the Lord we have all, therefore self has to die that our Lord may live and rule in us, it is my wish for me and mine.

Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
