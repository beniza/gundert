<14.>* Calw 14th April 69

My dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your good letters Now you are soon getting rain and the headache will pass I hope, thats right that you sleep on the veranda it is certainly cooller so did we,

That which you feel about the want of life among the brethren has been in our time it is sad; however I think that if one would begin it might be otherwise, for instead I felt the difference when Hebich was near us, because he was a man of much prayer, try also dear son pray and speak, it may be that one or two among the others would be glad to have one to help at all events thereby you remain true to your calling and more lively in the Lord, first because it requires more prayers if one speaks in Jesus name, and if one is somewhat moked the Lord gives doubel joy and assurance. The time is short and we should live as if it was our last year on earth. We are much in work making Louise Maurus beds, next week cleaning, white wash several rooms, then begin the time of visitors. I have much to fight and pray in order to keep quiet and calm, since the first of April it is fine weather, warm, the gardens are made and things are growing fast Paul has given us much joy, the Lord is with him. David is going on better too. May God bless and keep you my dear son

With a tender kiss
 Yours J.G.
