 Calw 25th April 1869
Dearest Frederic

I long to hear how you bear the hot season, have you still much headache? perhaps you troubel yourself too much about learning the language, evoied all that wich can agitate you and hinder your rest at night; Thinking and talking about you is still going on with us, and I am glad one has opportunity to hear and write every 8 days. the little private note to us alone I look for every time. and want to hear it twice, Oh dearest F you are in our hearts very often, and I comfort me in thinking you are still nearer to God than to us for He has said we are the appel of His eyes, we are portrait in His hands, our names are written in heaven, yes He cares for you well if you continew to be small and dependent upon Him distrusting yourself every day more and more To believe thats a wonderful thing I pray that you with me may understand what is that, faith! May God give you much hunger and thirst after His holy word and reveal Himself to you more and more in it. Jesus is our life out of Him of His word we are to drow life continually, we cannot make provision we must drow out of Him that is abide in Him our head,

We have still to clean for two days after that sitzung, on the 6th mission feast the Plebsts shall then come with G'mama perhaps, the Inspector too, the Wirzes salut you papa and son, Mrs W has great friendship with Mrs helfer and ober Amtman she seeks too much great things in this world, to try to please men brings us away from the Lord

May God preserve us from this spirit. Adieu my sweet son
 yours J.G.
