 <ca. 3 Octb>* [1869]
Dear Marie

These last days I have been rather occupied therefore did not write a line to you, and besides occupations the grief and sorrows hinder me writing. 
This week I have still much to do, it is so cold that we want the forewindows, they are to be cleansed, and a sewing woman beside Saurkraut is to be made etc

Theodor is very nice full of fann he is getting red cheeks and some what fuller than they were; I think you should leave him here at least till one sees how it goes with dear Charles, We all take good care of Theodor, you need not troubel yourself about him. I really think that he is better here than with you at least for the present. According to your letter dear Ch was better, but David who wrote after you says that he had a bad night, we grieve to hear it and send him best love and sincere wishes for a tolerabel season, I am glad to hear that little Ch is well and happy.

Please give my love to dear Mama Isenberg and Jetthen, what are the news about Peregrina?

Adieu dearest Marie
 With kisses to you both
 yours J Gundert
