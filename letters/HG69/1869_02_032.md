My dear Children

We had again a nice letter from you. by which it appears that you shall remain in Mountclemens at least it seemed so, as you will; but do the will of God. He shall be praised for His dealings however they may turn out 
To day we are sending a paquet to Bale for you, which shall reach you I hope safely. Your coat is made according to one of Frederic, should it be small you shall find in the sewing enough to make it larger, to dear Christina we send for her household a 12 of tea spoons. To the dear pets Emelie and Jettle are sending playthings

We have all Catarrh, papa was yesterday very poorly, had to send a telegram to Nagold that he could not come for the mission Conference. to day he is some what better. It is here not at all cold; but wet and unhealthy. With a tender kiss to all of you I remain
 Yours J.G.
