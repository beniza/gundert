Dearest Frederic

Your last told us of your going to Paulghat where I hope you recieved benifit for body and soul, and had much joy in visiting all the stations Cherical and Tellichery specially I long to hear how you found all there, the peopel will have shown you much love.

We thank the Lord who is so gracious to you and trust He will restore you to health fully. We have great joy to hear of Gods work all around you, surely the Lord has his own time, may the time be soon there for many, 
I have just seen Mrs. Wirz her little one which one thought diying is reviving again and one has good hopes that she will live, the old papa W is well and the whole family they send you love, All about us do you hear from papa also about dear Paul for whom I grieve deeply. We expect David next sunday! What a great grace if one is kept after ones conversion in a humbel state, as a child in Christ, may God keep you my dear son

 Adieu yours affectly JG.

love to all
