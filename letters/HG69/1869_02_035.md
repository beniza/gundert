 Calw 3d February 69
Dearest Frederic.

As one writes you in 8 days I write only a few lines, Your last letter has rejoiced us, I thought it would come just as you say. play much keeps one from studying Gods word which is our most needful occupation, These days I have been much taken up with our neighbour Biel, his wife the Nietammers daughter, her husband is a drankard who usually came home at midnight tipsy and often flaged her, the woman carried her cruz patiently learnt under it to know the Lord. As she was near death, he became ill too inflamation of the lungs, he then felt he had been wrong against his wife, on my advise he got up to beg pardon of his wife, she very quietly said I have long pardoned you. I had then some hopes the Lord would do a work in him, Helfer Schmid has been twice with him, the wife is to be burried to morrow, the man still ill; but no real repentance. Oh what great grace it is if one can repent even after we have believed, if we can feel our many daily faults, confess them get pardon and peace that is live to God, but justify one self excuse our fault is a hardening of the heart which works death. may God give that grace to all my children, to be strickt with themself crucifiing the flesh with its deeds.

Our Lord can keep you in health during the hot season as well as till now. whalk with Him, He is still the same who does wonders for those who can see Him and His works.

 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
