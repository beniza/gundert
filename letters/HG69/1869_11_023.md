My dearest Frederic

Your last letter has given me much joy as well that which you say about yourself as about our dear Paul, Yes the Lord is surely in the matter and will help so that His holy name be glorified. Today Paul is very happy sawing wood on the top of the house. Till now I felt excedingly distressed about him, fearing that there was pride and a wish to be a great man but now I do not think so any more and I feel quiet about him, I had a talk with him yesterday evening which has satisfied me regarding my fears, he wishes nothing but that Gods will be done, be a humbel work man his whole life is enough for him, what ever work God may give him, Carpenter or on the field, it is equal to him.

Now we will wait upon God who surely shall make all well, for Paul is most true and lives with God, walks with Him

Now Adieu dear Son God shall also care for your body, soul and spirit and prepare us all to met soon before Him
 Yours affectly JG
