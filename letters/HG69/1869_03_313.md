Dearest Frederic

For two well come letters many thanks, yes we live for Eternity as you say and feel, always more so, I thank God that you were abel to beg pardon to St first for your own profit; for the devil does not come so soon if one can humbel oneself and confess loud his cheating us, secondly for Mr Stolz who thereby can learn some thing perhaps unknown unto him, Oh dear son in that way you shall get the victory most surely and the peace, the joy, the quietness God gives to one after such confession or humiliation is already such a reward that we should never hesitate, or listen to the devil who knows well that by keeping silence or whithout repentance he has still power over us. The Lord be praised for His goodness and faithfulness to you. He leads you in the right way. Your letters give me always much joy, and though you are cast down now and then it helps also, to fix us more on the Lord intirely, and at last we become insensibel to those things which come from man which cause joy or sorrow, and we learn to rejoyece that our names are written in the book of life; caring little for other joy or desapointment, no dear son? It comes so gradually. The Lord the first we and others second, To day we made an appel cake for Paul and we said if only our Freddy could get a piece of it; Do you also fry plentains they are like an appel cake, My love to all those who remember us specially Hanna and Simeon in Armen house

Adieu dearest F
 Yours J.G.
