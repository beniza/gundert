Dearest Marie

We look anxiously for news from you, as dear Charles was ill the last time we heard. With us many people are ill and die of all classes and ages. Papa had a severe catarrh Jettle and myself had the grippe; but not so bad as you had it once, we did not keep the bed; but could have done it now and then a little, it is now nearly over thank God, we went to Hirsau and I paid many visits. Schnurle is a happy bridegroom his mother still angry. 
9th to day comes your letter no good news from dear Charles. I hope that you have gone with him to nurse him during the journey, as the liver is affected it may be a long illness during which he requires much cares I feel very anxious about him. the fever he had before was not so dangerous as the liver out of order, poor dear Marie I am sorry for you both; but perhaps it is only to do good to both of you according to your wish in you letter and we pray that it may indeed be so, so, that you both may say, my soul bless the Lord who has redeemed us from troubel.

Davids letters are more open and free; but the state of his mind grieves me deeply. I trust we shall soon hear from you again for we are longing after news. May our dear Lord realise all our sighs and prayers, yours and ours are of the same sort, by the spirit we unite in prayers according to Gods will not as the world, We have a father whose will we wish to do 
Adieu a tender kiss to you three
 yours JG.
