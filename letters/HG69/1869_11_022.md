My dear Children

Your laste has again given us joy specially to hear that dear Christina is so nicely. I trust and pray that she has a good winter with you all the Photografie of Julia brought by Mr Ward has given us much joy, and shows Julia as having gained very much she ressembles her Mama, has some thing fine and quieter than on the former, if she is as good, as diligent as her dear mama surely papa and mama will be much pleased with her, and dear Mariele we shall also get her once perhaps, we love both very much, and woold like to see them playing with Theodor, who is a little selfish. 
About our dear Paul you know everything, I have been much grieved and distressed about him, because I feared, that there was a high mind and a wish to become a great person, but now I do not think so, he is very happy sawing wood and will gladly do any kind of work, God will surely care for him and make all right,

Adieu my dear Children kisses to you four
 yours J.G.
