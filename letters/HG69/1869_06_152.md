Dear Children

Many thanks for the good news we got again from you and family. The different troubels you have with the congregation bring you nearer the Lord, for without much prayer you cannot do I wish you the great and true riches of which papa spoke last sunday in the meeting at Hirsau. which consists in having strength, or power from God to save souls, it was the riches of our Lord, so I fancy that in order to get that riches or power we have to learn well Phill 2,5-8 and get the mind of Jesus Christ, humbling ourselves as He did, becoming obedient as He was, if we learn this surely we shall feel or receive such power from God to work for Him, to hear well and be obedient in all things is a hard task, nevertheless without this we cannot abide in Him, disobedience has brought death into the world and we feel still that every disobedience causes death that is distant, far from our Lord; away from paradise. Oh may we learn to know to studdy our Lord and become indeed like Him. <15 Jun>* Anna Gundert has a girl, while Marie had still to wait when she wrote. We expects the Plebsts soon here, they will go with papa to Bale on the 26.

With hearty love to your dear wife to your two pets with kisses I remain  yours affect
 J.G.
