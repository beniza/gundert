My dearest Frederic

Yours of the 4th Nov has just come to hand, the illness has increased so rapidly that you have to quit Mangalore at once, We are happy to know that you are with our dear children at Palghot, where much care and love will be bestowed on you, perhaps a time of rest may prove beneficient and get strength for another journey, The Inspector writes about Mercara, we leave it to the Lord and have to learn to remain quiet waiting upon Him who alone can help, we would of coarse be glad if you were already in our midst, as the journey may be difficult and painful, and we wait anxiously to hear farther, I pray the Lord to keep your mind in perfect peace resting on the promises they are yours, what ever the ennemy may have to say, believe feeding on the word of life, May you be kept from doubts and temptations with a mind fixed upon the Lord.

We trust our dear Elisabeth is pretty well and that you shall have a good time together,

Our Paul is thank God going on better, friendly, more communicative, he is also bodily improving, has good appetite, looks well, gets stools without medecine, the evening an injection with salted water, the morning the whole body washed with cold water after which half an hour walking, It is a great burdan removed from us that he will studdy again, David is pretty well, halb Darbyist. about our dear Isenberg papa tells you the news as he was in Stutg lately

With hearty love to you all three
 Yours J.G.

I cannot write this time to dear Elis
