Dear Paul

We were glad to hear that your health is good and that through faith your soul prosper in the Lord. I saw Broun last sunday he is still the same, suffers much, does not like to take more pills, imagines that he has more pains when he uses the pills with those peopel one can do nothing must leave them to themselves.

Wegenbower I have not seen since a few weeks, In Hirsau I was last sunday Catherine Shill is pretty well, she can nurse her mother who is very ill. The little woman in Würtshaus has been ill, is now better, she came to the stunde, she is happy in the Lord. so is Cathrine Schill.

What do you say of poor Davids letter?

 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
