Dearest Marie

In this time we think of you specially, Jettle has beautiful dreams she will have told you every things, We trust on the goodness of the Lord who has done wonderfully and mercifully hither to for you and yours, and if all is not smooth and agreabel if profitabel for our souls we have to thank God who awakes us from sleep and shakes off the lukewarmness to which we are all inclined; Surely His love is great and unspeakabel, His love is true and pure, oh for some of such love

About our Missionfeast you hear all particulars from others. I shall be glad to see Paul and David here next sunday; the Lord be praised to have kept David and at last given him faith. Paul lives from grace it is a great secret this life hidden in God, that dependance intire upon God, taking continually out of His fulness, self thoughts, imagination have less power on us if we learn this secret, it was the way of the son of God who could say at all time not my will; but the one of my father May God give you much desire to do His will and joy in it however much it may be against flesh and blood, With true love and kisses to you all

 yours affectly
 J.G.

I have no time to dear Margaret to day love to her please
