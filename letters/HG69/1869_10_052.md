My dearest Frederic

It is already some weeks past since I wrote you my last note. During the time Charles and Mar were here I found no time to sit down for a few minutes; and I am now thankful to be abel to rest a little. Theodor who is still with us requires well much watching; but Jettle, Mrs Scheffel, Annele all do their best for him, at night he is with Jettle, the last letters of Marie about Charles health are not at all good as you will have seen by papas letter. our dear Marie may soon be left alone if the illness makes such progress; but it is the Lord He knows what is right and He is merciful; we will look upon Him and trust Him,

The good news about Moolkie have rejoiced me much may the Lord keep and bless those souls et let all the missionary learn some thing thereby the faithfulness and much prayers of dear Amman are rewarded and answered, He was a very fine man. though little esteemed from many others he was humbel and very zelous for His God, spoke at all times of Jesus, had continually the bibels words on his lips. My love to housefather and mother in the poor house, I love her dearly,

So you are in Paulghot may God give you joy and restore your health and strength David will also visit us as long as Paul is here.

 Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.
