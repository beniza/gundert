Dear papa

I should like to know how you have come to Tellicherry let me soon know please. With this I send a cooly for Mrs Muller at Chumbalah. They will take care of it at Telli. When I know the price of the things I shall write to Mrs Muller about them.

Frederic was not pleased of your having gone without him though he did not know where you had gone to. We are all well and wish you may find rest and comfort at Telli and get better before you return here.

I must finish Nathanael is to go buy the things and send off the cooly 
Christian love to all
 Yours aff
 J. Gundert

I just see that you have forgoten or I have the flanel banian I hope you have found one in the box

Mrs Irion shall pay the cooly
