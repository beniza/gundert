 Chiracal Wednesday morning 10 Apr <50>*
My dear wife

Plenty of love to you and the children - I hope you are all well. I arrived at Hebich's house just about midnight. The girl had been sleeping and no vomiting. The wind quite against us. - I hope you have no trouble from Fred. and that he is pleased with his trip. Here every thing quiet, Joseph <Kandapp>* alone laid up with a boil, so that he cannot do any thing. In Cann. the disease is still amongst the people that came from Tahe. Heb. has emptied the Tahehouse entirely. Searle serves in Anj for Timoth who is still weak. Yesterday I had an honorable visit on my walk, and after all about 10 Nayers accompanied me home, quite anxious to hear and learn! - perhaps there has been judgment passed on the late transgressors: however it was I was quite surprised by their submissive behaviour.

Jacob the cook does well no quarrelling about the kitchens as far as I can see and hear. From Anjerc I just hear that several (also one Christian - Joshua) died of Cholera.

Now farewell. If you donot write I shall send the bandy Saturday afternoon. The house is very empty steamer and Gauches lament that they are so forsaken! Peace with you
 Your HGdt
