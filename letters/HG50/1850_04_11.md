 Tellicherry Thurday
 <11 April 50>*
Dear papa.

Though I have nothing importent to say: I will send one line. We are all together pretty well Paul very happy eating plenty. Frederic nicely too now and then papa mam, in going out the evening he says now we go to papa and then laughs heartly: but when the bulloks take again the way of Nettour he looks a little serious saying Ah, not to papa.

Would you not think it well to come in the bandy which is to fetch us and so go to Tellicherry the day we leave it We shall then meet in the midle of the road in changing of carriages, they all expect you here. If the grass cutter can come to be here on friday evening I would send the goats by him on saturday morning early. If he can not come let me know I shall send them by a cooly. how is the Horse keeper?

Mrs I. is pretty well though the night was not so good as the preceding ones.

I met yesterday Mr Fitzgerald they intend to stay here the remaining part of this month Now Adieu Love to Marie to H. Salams to all
 Yours J. Gundert
