Dear Sir

I am sorry you should have taken amiss your Moonshee's absence, as I see no reason to doubt the excuse he gave for it. We wished that he serve you the full time stipulated and could not feel at liberty to encourage any deviation from his engagements without your consent. We may perhaps find a successor for him that may suit you, but I should say from my experience that men warranted never to absent themselves are rare in these parts.

Dear Sir,

I would feel obliged if you would procure me another Moonshee as my time is precious and I can not put up with an excuse every day*
 Yrs truly
