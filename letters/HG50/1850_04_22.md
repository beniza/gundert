My dear wife

I arrived here about 1/4 to 8 o'clock having left Cann just about gunfire; at the same moment when I put off in the boat Chr MÃ¼ller left Chombala, and arrived of course before me. I had hardly arrived when I was told that Irions (Mrs I. being still affected by headache) are going to Chomb and he perhaps farther on to Calicut, so that I shall be more homely here than I expected, he having offered me all his rooms So I may now stretch arms and legs to any length I like. - It was not hot this morning and I feel quite easy. News there are none of interest or I would tell them. That the Bandy which Brennen wanted is taken to pieces, you have perhaps heard: I shall let him know soon.

Hayes also sends Selams to you.
 With love I am
 Yours HGdt

Kiss the children both for me. Christian etc are also going to Chomb.
