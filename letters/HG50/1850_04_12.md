 <Friday>*
My dear wife <(in Tellich>*

Only plenty Selam with the grasscutter, whom you will order to take the goats tomorrow. I trust you are all well. You will not know perhaps that Chirutas Isaak <(11 Apr)>* (Thomas) has been taken away by the Lord. She bears it well and I believe will profit by it. And now with kisses to the children farewell
 Yours HGdt
<Chir.>* Friday <12>* noon
