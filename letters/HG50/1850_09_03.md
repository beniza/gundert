My dear wife

Here is the goldwatch - the new spring cost but 1 Rup (for us). I hope it goes well. I send with it Mrs Cummins last for yesterday afternoon it induced me to hold the first Malayalam service (an "i pay") after more than a year. I baptized Samuel's Phinehas who was born only 7 days ago and seems dying of convulsions. Mrs C. went along with me to the sickroom. So I thank God for having tried so much without injury to me. We do not hear from MÃ¶glg for a long time indeed. He will now be at Bangalore. Sham R is going on to my satisfaction, very anxious to learn and asking about all he does not understand. I hope he will be a faithful servant in his line. 
Love to my children and I send them here some pictures! May peace be with you and
 Yours HG
