Rev H. Gundert, Chiracal

 Tellicherry Wednesday
 <10 April 50.>*
Dear papa.

After you had gone I much regretted not to have thought of putting a mat or some what in the botom of the boat for you to sit, how did you come home? 
When I told you that our bandy should come to wait at the Temples for us I forgot that Hebich bandy should be at Chiracal for the sunday therefore the bullocks bandy may come with us till Chiracal and be there for sunday. I have written to day to Mrs Muller at Chumbalah that I find difficult to go to them and to excuse me.

I hear that the horse keeper has not yet returned because of his leg which is not well he is taking some remedy from his friends or relations I have not seen him.

Mrs Irion has had such good news of her brother's marriage that she is quite well says she, by his marriage he is to get half of the fabrique which belongs to the father of his bride. he has sent his carde finer then some of the English ones I have seen, every things seams so brillant and superfine the Mother can scarcely contain her joy. Now Goodbye The horse ke will take this he has just come We are all pretty well
 Yours aff J. Gundert
Tuesday evening
