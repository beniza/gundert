My dear brother

I just now receive your welcome letter with my wife's inclosure and as this is the last time for writing my wants, I without ceremony ask for your oxenbandy to stand on the top of the hill halfways - when? Saturday morning at 5 o'clock. Do you hear and mark? and let my dear wife understand with thanks for her letter that the horsebandy is to meet me at Temple's and is to wait there at 6'oclock. I hope to be able to leave this at four in the morning and may they arrive early with God's grace. I hope you send this out to Chiracal.

Thomas is well again and looks cheerful. I walked this morning to his house and saw also Ananda's new built house near the road

And now farewell with plenty Selams and may peace be with us and the Israel of God!
 Your HG
