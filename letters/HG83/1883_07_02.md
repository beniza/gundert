My dear,

The trip on Friday was hot, but I liked to see the Pl. at Lfn, had an agreeable ride to Ilsfd and met there with the 3 cousins from Kaltenwesten. The brother of Chinese Lörch preached, then Fritz and I. In the evening returned to Lfn and Bietigh with Fr. and slept at Pforzh. In the morning I was there for Miss R and procured for her some coffee, made our voyage all well under an increasingly tropical heat and arrived 1 1/2 at B. John Adis Herm were there, also studts to take our baggage. Slowly we went our way and got at last some rain that made us walk quicker under shelter. The 2 childr cough still very seriously. I hope to come Friday 3 P. M. for it is desirable that the Hesses start on Saturday morning for their stay in the country. I hope we shall not perspire too much. It is really very hot this day, tho' it rains again at again. Dubois came here Friday evening and no more since
 Goodbye
