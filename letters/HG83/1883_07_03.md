<(An Papa nach Basel)>*

 <Calw Dienstg 3 oder 4. Mittwo July 1883>*

Many thanks dear papa for your Carte which I was very glad to get. We thought much of you on account of the heat, even here it is hot. David had a long talk <etwa Sonntag 1. July>* with Mr Kopp and was pleased. I thank dear Marie for her kind letter to me; but I can not ansewer it; my eyes do not allow it, I am very sorry to hear that the children cough still so much, in Calw one sees several children on the streets with hooping cough. 
May God give you grace to speak with joy of the richess of His grace, words of life which shall abide

Much love to the dear Children I wish them a good and blessed time â€¦ la Campagne

With kisses
 yours JG.
