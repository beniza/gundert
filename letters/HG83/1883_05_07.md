An Herrn D Gundert, 6 hohe Str. in Stuttgart

 <7 Mai 83>1
Lieber D

I would only say that Pr's death ought to be printed large "7 Apr. in Accra, Goldcoast" I have in my mind to come and see dear Praet, if he accepts a visit, on Wednesday. Say in company of dear Georg who I suppose can say if it is acceptable. Well I come and hear and see then for myself. Herm has received letters. Just now Eugenie Els. will come to us - the bridepair visited us yesterday. Goodbye for the present with kiss
