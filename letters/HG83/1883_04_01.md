An Herrn D Gundert, 6 Hohe Straße in Stuttgart

 <1 Apr 83>1
My dear D.

I intend to go tomorrow (Monday) to Eßlingen, shall therefore be on the perron from 9.30-9.35. bring with me maps of Grundem. and the Betb. which Willy perhaps might fetch. You might also ask G Pl if he will not accompany me to Mrs Kr. whom I purpose to see particularly. His coming along would be a great pleasure. If not, he may perhaps tell Willy where I am to seek the house of our late friend Kr

 Goodbye for the present Yr F.

DV I return to you in the afternoon
