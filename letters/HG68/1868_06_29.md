Dear Frederic

It seams me a long time since we heard of you, did you speak with tante Emma on the subject I told you, has she kept for herself that which I unwisely told her about you? tell me a word about it. Jettle is in Liebensel, I shall perhaps go to Hirsaw where the Colporteur Fisher will have the Stunde, This week we shall have much to do, putting tapete in our schlaf and wohntzimmer besides a wash and cleaning papa s room, You have not writen since tante has a son, how are mama and child? can she nurse her son? 
I hope that you have good time with David, praying together. I read again Hebich s last words, the more I read them the more I like them and learn from them. May I walk as he did so true, so faithful regarding God alone. 
 Adieu dear son
 Yours J.G.
