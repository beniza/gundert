 Calw Sunday <20 April 68>*
Dear Frederic

You will be disapointed to hear that you are not allowed to present yourself at the examination or Musterung, as papa will tell you. However there will still come a time that we may see and injoye each other, we must only have patience and be thankful for the many good things which God gives us. If we value and apreciate the great gift made us in the son of God we shall always be grateful and think little of every thing else

How are you dear son? May our Lord give you many blessings by his word and spirit

 Love to all
 yours JG.

20 Your letter just recieved gives me great joy because you take your delight in Gods word
