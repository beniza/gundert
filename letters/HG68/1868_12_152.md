My very dear Frederic

Sunday we got a letter from Marie and Plebst, we of course thought after dinnar comes one from Frederic; but none, tomorrow morning comes one, morning again none, poor papa went on his walk rather sad, afternoon I found papa lieng on his Sopha I asked wether he had fever, he said, no, but I miss my Friderle letter. the evening after the post had arrived one went to hear if a letter was there again in vain, so now we must wait 8 days longer, which is not so easy for us since we heard from Plebst that you had to watch at night a sick brother, we are very sorry for it, you have no strength to spare specially during the nights, We really anxious for you and long impatiently to hear, evoid I pray you to watch at night; you are no strong man. We feel we must look upon the Lord and wait upon Him till news come from you, the Devil trys his best to trouble us with many fearful thoughts about you, but God helps us to believe - and seek to remain quiet on Him alone. I can only pray if you should be ill too that our dear Lord keep you in place of father and mother, let you feel His tender love giving you faith and confidence to be healed again Oh sweet Frederic we feel how united we are with you; how we suffer with you and bear you continually in our hearts to the true phisician who can help you and give you good courage.

Do spare your health and dont put yourself forward to help too much if the comity allows, Diez will return to India, perhaps your house mother might go with I would be glad if it could be, Have you found milk do not care what it costs health is more than money care not for gelt God has enough I kiss you tenderly and press you on my heart
 yours J.G.
