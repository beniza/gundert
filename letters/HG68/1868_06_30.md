Dear papa

At last Marie s letters just as we had finished dinnar. I trust you have a good time in Bale.

Knorr did not come to us but to Ross, he paid us a visit with his friend teacher Schmid. he Knorr was quite surprised when I told him not to do with God as he did to us, being invited to say I was not so frei*! 
Frederic and David have written, are both happy.

We are in the midst of wash and cleaning, The Decan has gone to Tubingen for some days. We are all well

In haste with love
 yours J.G

Emelie would have like to make longer than me in giving you news; but there is no room
