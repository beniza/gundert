Dear Children.

A few lines only. Your last has again given us joy in seing how the Lord is becoming your Lord and ruler; your best portion, yea in Him we have all, and are perfectly happy, We can rest upon Him in perfect assurance for body soul and spirit, also for the health of our dear Christina, He is our physician, as soon as we have learnt what the Lord has to tell us through the illness, or trial of any sort. He is ready to help us; but the first thing is to see and understand what is his mind toward us. We thank the Lord who gives you joy in your dear little ones.

Paul and David came to day, the first should have come yesterday; but he lost his way after Herrenberg, went the one of Böbling so he had to pass the night to Gechingen being to tired to come here, He does not look very well, but is happy it seems, David has a new elan <französ = Aufschwung>*, finds much food in Gods word and grows in grace and in knowlege. 
With a tender kiss to each of you I remain
 Yours J.G.
