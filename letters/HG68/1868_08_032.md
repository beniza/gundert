 <C 3 Aug 68>*
Dear Paul,

I am sorry to hear that your stomack is not so well as we expected. God will teach us something; may we hear!

I râ€šjoiece to see you next sunday, I have changed the day of our wash on account of Frederic so I shall be free to go.

I trust the Lord will help you. You should try to take un lavement Klistier every time you have been to the place, it works better if one takes it afterward, that is, it prepares, cools, for the next time, and the head is not affected by it if the stomack is emptied.

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.

The sermons of L Hofacker I shall bring you with great pleasure
