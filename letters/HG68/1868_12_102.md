 <10 December 1868.>*
1My beloved Frederic.

We had nothing from you this time; but heard about you the Lord who has lead you hither too will keep you from all evil, and make you a blessing for some, which is a great honour. In Stutgart where I went again all were well talked much of you, Caroline and Charles came with me and shall stay here a while, the Lord has given her true repentance! she is truly humbeld, has still very sad times whether the Lord can pardon her she doubts often. How is your watch if it does not go well we shall send you one by Emelie I repent not to have given you one before you went. David was nice with me; but has as yet no peace nor joy, does not love the Lord as he says. however he is loved I know and shall believe it once

 Adieu with kiss yours
