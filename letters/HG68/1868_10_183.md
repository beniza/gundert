 Calw 18th Octo 1868
Dearest Freddy

You are perhaps to day in Polghoat Papa sais no you are in Madras looking at the town and all what is to be seen there, We long very much to hear from you, we expected a letter to day, but none has come except from Marie and S. Mrs Schwarz has sent us grapes, the little Samuel is better likes his Ama well a woman from Calw Tante Emma is well sends you love as well as Gross Mama from Barmen, Yesterday 17 Paul left us. I had first some anxiety about him, he eats so very little and the homeopathy did not help much, but the Lord is so gracious to him, he preached twice in Stamheim, the word of life dowelleth richely in him and flowes abundently in all his conversations. he visited several sick peopel here, he lives really with the Lord and to the Lord speaking of Him is his delight.

David is as before, writes but a few lines wishes to love us and come nearer; but it remains till now in mere wishes. From Uranie I heard at last, she had much joy to see you, she will send in January for each of you 100 franks which are to be put in spare casse. Dearest F. We have been much with you in spirit and in conversation. You will have felt that we were in prayer for you daily, I have good confidence that our Lord will bless you and make you a blessing for many, open your mouth in His name He shall fill it with words of life which communicate life and help you in all your troubels, for without troubels you cannot be for your text was he calls on me in troubels and I will hear him. PS 91 15 I think often of the text 
Adieu my very dear son
 yours J.G.
