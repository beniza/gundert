Dear Paul

I thank you for the news about yourself and Louise Maurus. Please give her our love when you see her and inquire about her health.

Next sunday papa has to preache in Stamheim We read in our morning services the old testament to day it was about Aron having made a Calf. it is to me a real blessing to hear again about those different types of our Lord. papa takes a good deal of troubel to explain us all he reads.

 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
