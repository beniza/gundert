 Calw 29th Februar 68
Dear Paul

Did Mrs. Desselberger remain with you in Cannstatt and how long? how did you come to Tubingen?

Please send me your wash on next friday 6 March so that I have it saturday here.

So in three weeks you shall be here D.V. We are as glad of it as yourself to morrow morning papa is to preach in Stamheim afternoon in Hirsau. I came from Stutgart with toothache and I have it still a little.

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
