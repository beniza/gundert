 <Aug 68>*
Dear Paul

Yesterday I went to Hirsau there visited the two sisters who are ill, they are happy in the Lord and send you hearty love, they hope to see you next time you come. they have found an old paper torn already in which it was written about halbbatz collecte for mission. they will also try to collect. they must be instructed how it is to be done. So the Lords work comes in mind as soon as one has found the Saviour

David is still the same. The Lord will hear us in His good time 
 Adieu yours J.G.
