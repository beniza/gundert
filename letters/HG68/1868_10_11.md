My very dear Frederic

I have but just time to write you a few lines. The Diezes are with us and to morrow we have sitzung. Paul is still with us till saturday; last sunday he preached in Stamheim I heard him, the Lord is with him, but imagine he studies from five the morning till supper, he eats almost nothing he is very thin, I told him my fears about his fasting so much and so long, but he answred me he has made it up with the Lord, I can be quiet about him, he studdies in the salle for he finds his room to noisy through peopel walking in the corridor. The homeopathy works very slowly with his stomach. David is still a Jew just the same as you left him. I feel really grieved about him, but men cannot help. The WÃ¼rzes send you hearty love, the Diezes too with many other peopel, Mrs Schwartz has sent us fine grapes, Adolph's baby is better To day a person from Stamheim whom I donot know has sent me a basket ful of Apfels, the preaching of Paul pleased her so much, The days are becoming very short, To day you are in point de G. and separated from Eugenie who wrote home how glad she was to have you on board. Now my very dear F I trust you see still the dear Plebst give them my love and to the dear Pfeiderer and to all those who remember us

May God bless and keep you dear son with a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
