Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your good letter; so you had again a difficult time and were discouraged your sister has been often so and used to say my praying helps nothing I am always the same. however God has helped and He will also help you; as soon as we can confess our sins and faults with grief, repentance, the Lord is ready to help; but we must be earnest before our Lord and if true repentance is not in us we must pray for it; loose not courage be fervant in prayer! we know and understand little what is that be fervent in prayer. May God bless you.

The present Unkel Gustave makes us is really valuabel and I thank him heartily it is too much.

Adieu dear Frederic
 Yours J.G.
