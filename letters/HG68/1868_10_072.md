Dear children

Many thanks for yours of 29 August. had it reached here before papa went to Bale with Frederic, he would have followed your advice and visit the family Stockmeyer of whom I heard nothing since you were here, I read with delight the Christianes Denkmal, the letters of papa are especially a real food for me, the 15 and 16th chapter are most edifiing I am just now in the 21first Chapter in which also the strength of faith is to be felt under severe trials. It is certainly for us all still a blessing to have had such a father and mother.

I hope that by this time you have got the 6 shirts with the little dolls! Mrs. Gross has written to her son about them, she thinks that Henry has not looked till the bottom of his box and they have been forgotton I trust it is only forgetfulness.

Our dear Paul has long vacances this time of which we are all very glad, he is not yet quite well though he has tryed homeopathy already 8 weeks; he will still continue after a pause,

Your letters give us joy we feel that the Lord is working. that is putting reality instead of the dreams which occupied you formerly, May our Lord become your own and all, We have but a short time more in this world; may we have grace to confess Him who has loved us, separet us from the world, May the Lord bless you richly with dear Christine and daughters

With hearty love
 Yours J.G.
