Dear Frederic

So our dear Lord will also take you in His service. The quietness He has given you during these last weeks is to me a sighn that our merciful Lord will make something of you, and use you in His holy work. That the holy God takes us poor sinners poluted, unclean sinners to be His witnesses is so great so merciful that I can but humbel myself and say it is pure mercy, pure grace to me, He who allowes you to go will fit you to work in His holy name, may you be truly humbel and small true to your Lord, pleasing Him in obedience following your Lord. We shall soon see each other I trust 
 adieu yours J.G.
