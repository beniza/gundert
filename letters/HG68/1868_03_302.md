 <30 Maerz 1868>*
Dear Frederic

I know you will excuse me for writing on such a miserable bit of paper, 
2 thank you very much for having sent me such beautiful piece of Shirting and so cheap. Emelie and Jettle who got a part of it are very much pleased. When Paul comes or rather when you come I have still to troubel you for 6 yeards of Orlean black for lining of the best you have and 8 yeards of grey futter sarcenet also of the best and strong and also for half Gulden or 40 creu of black silk not of the very fine by <Bortenmacher Fernand Königsstraße>* We would have liked to have you along with your two brothers; but you come still I trust as long as Paul is here. He has become very thin and does not look quite well. Please pay the silk for me I shall repai it you when you come. also a Gulden of Merredig by Tante please tell her, I know that she has bought more than she wants for herself and will let me have some, pay them please

 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
