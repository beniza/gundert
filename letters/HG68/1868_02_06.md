Dear Frederic

Many thanks for your letter and for the great present you have made to papa for his birthday. it was right that his sons gave him some thing instead of his wife who never gave him any thing. On your birthday you shall perhaps be here it would be very nice if it was so. one might then give you a kiss as present! you would like it just as much? In Nagold it was very nice a mission conference is still nicer than a Mission feast: but from every side one hears of the difficulty one has to get money for the mission, there are so many other wants and petitions that the mission remains behinde. 
 Now Adieu dear Son

love to both tante in your house
