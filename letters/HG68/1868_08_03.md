Dear Frederic

Please in writing to BÆ’le to ask what you are to bring Papa says that you get every thing there that is, the things you may want besides those you have already, Shirts and stockings they have always ready for those who are sent, but it is good to ask. After the wash I shall arenge your things. and when I come to Stutg take with me shirts of Paul so that all yours remain clean to go.

 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
