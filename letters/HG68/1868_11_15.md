Dear Paul

I thought much of you to day in reading in the epistel of Colossians I had such nice quiet time, could eat the bread of life, what treasures and riches are in those few chapters. the great mystery Christ with His church Christ with in us, He our life, if He lives in us sin must go, all the lusts of the flesh must be crucified.

Accept thanks for your note just recieved. Yes our Lord is good in Him we have true joy. I felt the same as you regarding David. God be praised for the work began

 Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
