Dear Children

Many thanks for your dear note of 13th May. I trust dear Tines hand is getting better and better, and proves that the sympathy of our dear Lord is better than the one of men. You ask after Paul and the spasms which troubeld him he has been a pretty long time free from them, they come it seems in consequence of a long time of constipation, in Maulbroon he has been often 6. 8. even 10 days without opening of the bowels, now he takes pills every day; but which do not work enogh. We are now that is when he comes next vacances to try homeopathy; and hope it will be more effectual than all the remedies we have tried hitherto. I was lately in Stutgart for one day, Tante is not at all well, she must keep on an easy chair the whole day, on account of a swelling she has under the knee, her health seems to give way rapidly, Mama as chearful as ever takes care of the two households, they send you hearty love; but impossibel to write.

I hope that you have preached your english sermon and that it has not been too difficult, It will be good for your children to learn english. little ones can learn so very easily

With best wishes and tender kisses
 to all of you. Yours J.G.
