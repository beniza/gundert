Dear Children <Marie>*

So the Lord has helped beyond all expectation to Him be praise, you have in this happy delivrance a sign of the love of your heavenly father, and if you can believe He will also give you spiritual children according to your desire, I am glad to take Frederic as parrain it was papa's desire. May God give you joy in Herman as he has hitherto given you in Theodor I am glad you can nurse do it as long as you can, though you should have but little milk it does not matter give canji beside your own milk, and nurse if you can a whole year.

We were rejoiced at the good news dear Charles gave about the young man who wishes still to be baptised. God will give you much more such souls, but before it, he will give you, much prayer for the holy spirit that it be poured out As soon as the Spirit of God comes it revives the dead bones, we can but mouve and turn them with an appearance as if there were life; but they remain dead, Yea dear children you there and we here should pray much more for Gods spirit, all our doing, talking help little a perfect dependance upon our Lord is wanted, if we do this He shall still show that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Expect every thing from Him even expect much. He shall glorifie His name if we will have none of our own. 
Adieu May God bless you richly. My love and thank to dear Margaret I shall DV answer an other time
 Yours JG
