 <16 April 68>*
Dear Paul

I trust your box has reached you safely.

I hope likewise that the journey on foot has not hurt your health. 
You would be glad I suppose if you could every month have a work as you had in Gruppenbach for 8 days? But the time will soon come where you shall have daily opportunity to preach and witness.

Next time tell us something of your health

 Goodbye dear Son
 Yours J.G.
