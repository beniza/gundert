Dearest Marie

Again good news from you all not withstanding the great heat, yea our Lord can help beyound all expectation, let us only be true and faithful He realises all His promises to us, He is a wonderful God, upright with the upright, are we honest with Him He shows Himself true to all that He said, to Him be praise for all His goodness to you and yours, mind it is grace pure grace; but obedient we are to be. He has His conditions with us as He had with his people Israel but of an other sort. in John we find them. 
About pour M. I pity you, I had expected that the time of troubels she had to go through had helped something but as it has not, I do not think that you have a duty to go on so with her, all has been tried for her for and after her trials as nothing helps I would tell her and let her seek a work by which she might get her livelyhood without living on the Mission, to have to care for herself may bring her down, I do not see how she can be helped otherwise, to come to herself, for body and soul it may cure her, to be forced to work and humble herself, had not many already tried with her these 20 years, I would not feel justified to speak so, but Mrs. Hauff Hoch Fritz have done their best without any succes.

22. I have to go to Tinach therfore only time to send a kiss to each of you. Mrs Fink is here she is well expects a little one. Adieu in love  Yours J.G.

Mrs Baetzner is near her end it seems.
