 <17 April 1868>*
Dear Frederic

I pray what have you done such an expensive thing to have sent me. Oh dear I thank you heartily; but truly I am sorry for your expense, for we have in the house such needful meubel. Louise has used it during long time, it belongs to Jettle it is true; but we use it as our own.

Do not send orleans I shall give of the one I have

Mr Wirz has sent your cloth. I do not buy more till I see what remains after your things are made

 Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.

Louise Maurus who is just here sends you love

one says that Fetzer does not go any more
