Dear Children

Many thanks for your good letter <v. 17 July>* as you get from others many news; I will only talk of the health of dear Christine, I have also had much constipation and would have still if I was not careful to avoid food which cause it, were I to drink wine and eat salted meat I would get piles, with which I have been troubeld long in India in consequence of constipation. I would advise dear Christine to try homeopathy, it seams to agree well with Paul, From Stutgart Frederic has sent him three small bottles filled with small pills Nux vomica 2 Pulsatilla 3 Sulphur, The evening one has to put three of those pills only of one sort say nux vomica in a glass of water disolve them drink half of it the evening and the other half next morning. On the second evening take again 3 pills of the second sort pulsatilla and drink the water in which they are desolved as on the first day. On the 3d day take of the 3d sort Sulphur and do like wise, and repeat so the three different pills every day till one is quite well; changing every day, One has to avoid strong drik and strong smell, no wine, no caffe, nothing sauer.

May God give his blessing to these means and make dear Tine soon well, Mr Heartman who is just now here says of Christine she is a beautiful woman a real beuty! May the Lord say of her she is mine and is faithful. With a hearty kiss to you four
 yours J.G.
