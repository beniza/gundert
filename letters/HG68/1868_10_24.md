Dearest Frederic

To day I am much with you in thoughts, fancy you to be still in Palghot see perhaps Tantele Emma or what, perhaps also in Tellicherry, saw there your brothers grave, your Isabella, and many others who have joy to see you again, In praying for you I could but repeat keep him watch over him, lead us not into temptation; if we are desobedient and unfaithful the Lord let us fall into temptation, therefore has He said watch and pray that he fall not into temptation there are many sorts of temptations, it may be in a difficult path where one does not or see which is the will of God, or where men stand too high too great before us and we fear them or honour them more than God, there are many ways in which the devil and men may troubel us, and I believe that to pray with faith the words I must pray for you today is a great preservatif. that intire dependance on God, with the feeling of our intire depravation and ableness to do all sorts of evil must follow us continually so that we look on the Lord alone always. Papa had the missionary meating in the church this afternoon, he related of Abeukuta and Madagasgar, after which a good prayer of the heart, From Stamheim we had many presents of apels and zwetchen, the peopel wanted to show their thankfulness and joy at Paul two preachings there. his letter to you and Samuel has just arrived they please me well, and so the good Shepherd will also take care of him. Yes my dearest our Lord will bless you and make you a blessing, My love to all those who remember us
 yours JG.
