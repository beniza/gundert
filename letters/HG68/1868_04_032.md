 <3 April 1868>*
Dear Frederic

You will have been surprised to get no letter from us through David; but you know already how the time is usually filled up.

Now you can soon see your papa with Paul and I trust that you come along, and will be so kind as to bring me the black silk, the Orlean, the grey futter, and the merredig, and still one thing that is one dozen of balls of Cotton 2 black <pto>1 We will write about it to Gross Mama so that Paul may bring with the reddig, but the sewing silk I pray you to care for and the things of your laden.

Look well at your things before you come to see what you should buy here for your summer.

Adieu dear Son
 Yours JG.

You shall also bring yours and Davids wash or send it per Beiser 
11 Loth schwarze Mailänder Nähseide bei Possamentier Fernand in der Königsstraße. Mittlere Gattung, weder ganz fein, noch sehr grob.
