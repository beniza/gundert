Dear Frederic

The letter you were to get to day from papa, will have made you thoughtful and prayful, in order to know which is Gods will. We pray also for you. Our dear Lord will let you know what you are to do and keep your mind in peace and quietness, waiting calmly on Gods time; be not in a hurry except you know Gods will. It is less difficult for you than if you were a missionary, the responsability is much less though you can do as much as a missionary if you heart is filled with the love of Jesus. You have began to speak of your Lord here trying to bring some to Jesus, His grace will increase to make you a true witness You have felt in Steigers school that love is the chief thing wanted to lead and teach others, yea so well in India as here, the true love, pure love of Jesus must constrain us to seek the souls and bring them to their Saviour.

May God Himsel show you the way you are to go, pray much wait upon the Lord,

 Adieu dear Son yours J.G.
