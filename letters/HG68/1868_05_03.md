 Sunday <3 Mai 1868>*

As I hear dear Frederic that Mr Weitb goes to Stutg, I send you a good morning and day.

The 6th of John makes my joy Oh what a fulness, if we realise in truth what is that eat the flesh and drink the blood of Jesus Christ, without which we have no life, this secret we must study daily by reading the word of life which becomes in us really the blood and flesh of the Lord, His power and strength is communicated to us in the word of life. May you have much hunger and thirst after that bread of life and therby feed others too Adieu  yours JG.
