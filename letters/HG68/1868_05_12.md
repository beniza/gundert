Dear Children

Your last letter given such sad accounts of dear Christines illness has grieved us deeply, it must be very painful for her, very trying, I do hope that the last remedy which you were just trying have prooved more effectual than those used before, let us know all about it please; for we feel much for dear Christine. You have now learnt how you are to accept trials and what to make of them; but to use them well we have to pray much. 
With dear GrandMama who is here for a few weeks we speak much of you, of your wife and children, she would like to see her Ã„nkele, She has much admired Julias drowing, made me to observe "the straitness of her strockes the house with how much thoughts and patience it has been done, in fact none of her children could have done such a chef d'oeuvre not even the Helfer Ernst nor his children they have no patience for it, Julia must have much patience and a peculiar talent", dear child I do hope that she learns indeed to look to the Saviour and pray not only for Mama s ilness; but for a new heart. Your last 6 shirts left yesterday <by Robert Gros der zu seinem Br Herm. nach NYork geht>1, I would have liked to join to them a few playthings or a blanket; but we feared to load too much the bearer of the paquet. We hope also that the time is not so very far to see you here with yours. Adieu dear children
 with true love yours J.G.
