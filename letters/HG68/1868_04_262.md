 <26 April 68.>*
Dear Frederic

Good evening, to day I felt so tired from wash and cleaning the house that I could not go to Altburg with papa. Emelie went with him. I long to hear of you both through Jettle and GrandMama. Today it has not rained but it is rather cold. I hope the Lord gives you words of life for your few friends there, and that you have joy and peace.

 Love to all
 Yours J.G.
