Dear children

I quite forgot that today was the day of writing and so now I must make haste, to send you my love and thanks for your last letter which has caused me joy. I am glad that at last the paquet came and that it was but forgetfulness from Heinrich Gross, the 2 collars for the children were sent and made by Miss Seeger, Your daughters must learn well her name Emilie Seeger 
I am glad you had a pleasant journey seeing our relations. it is sad that the old Salis has not yet learnt to know himself and do what the Lord requires of us, that is hate his life and renounce to all he has, thats a hard lesson for us all and we have to learn it daily. Our repeated mistakes and sins help us to it, so that we wish at last really to have done with self and be lead by our Lord alone.

I hope dear Christine is well and shall have a good winter with her two pets, May our Lord bless you all with love in haste
 yours JG.
