Dearest Marie

Many thanks for yours of 5th Oct I have just taken your note and bild to Mrs Keiser who was exceedingly glad and sends you as well as her mother hearty love she will soon write you, she has been to the baptisem of her sister s son; mother and child well, Mrs Schmidhener was here she sends much love too, she has the same difficulty as ever with servant girl. she looks poorly. Dear child look more to that which is above, think that the Lord may come very soon then you will be able to praise the Lord for all His deelings with you seek not of injoying so much what you have, have your joy and delight in the Lord, in His will. You have taken the death of Herman too much at heart, if the Lord would take your husband as He has done for many others what would you do? if you love the Lord more than husband and children you must confess, that in the last case you have given way too much to feelings, We have to learn to live from realities setting our affection on that which is above and show before the world and christians that God s will and ways are perfectly right and with ful Amen accepted from us We have to do with a living God a jalous God. If we cannot understand and follow some what Paul according 1 Corinti 9,27. God must teach by some other ways to hate our life and renounce all that we have, the time is short and we are to use the gifts of God in ours as if it was soon the end 
Adieu dear children a tender kiss to you three love to Margueret
