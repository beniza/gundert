 Calw 27 April 1868
My dear Emma

Pardon my having been so long without thanking you for your wellcome note of December 67 You were then grieved to have to care so much for the body while much work might have been done instead of resting on the hills. So does our Lord puts aside those who seam to us so needful for his work, but He understands well what He has to do, could we but understand too, we would not cease to thank and praise Him. During such seasons we learn what we would not have learned in health and with God that is the important thing; not work and labour but that we learn to know His will, when we have learnt to know ourselves, to hate our life, to dispair of self and with a full heart with stand, resist, overcome that beast self, our dear Lord shows us that we can do all things in Him, and after Paul say and experience when I am weak then I am strong in the might of Him who works all in us, willing and doing I think that in heaven we* shall* wonder looking back on the sickness and trials we have to go through here, the blindness, deafness, want of understanding, which hinder us to know what the Lord will have of us are great, joined to excuses and unbelief. the patience and longsuffering of the Lord is wonderful

These days I have still to learn, we had wash and cleaning during 14 days, such exertion passes not without excitement on my part as according to my nature I like the things to be done quickly, for which other peopel care, little sooner or later it will be done; so I got diarrhea in consequence of my being excited; but I know the Lord will teach me by it and give me the victory over my nature, making true the text or Loosung I got this year, which is "Der Herr eur Gott, hat euch zur ruhe gebracht"

Jettle is in Stutgart to see her aunt who is ill, she is to return tomorrow with our dear Mama, whom I rejoice to have in our house, from her I have to learn to do things in quietness with much activity though.

I am glad that when we come to Stut we can get loge with her or Tante Emma, I had a real joy with them last time I was there, both are growing in the Lord visibly.

You know that we have good news of our dear Hermann, the Lord has found him, his letters show how the Lord is leading him.

Please give my love to dear Mrs Faulies to the Groves and to all those who remember us.

May God soon bring you back to Mangalore with good health and strength 
Love to your dear partner with best wishes for the faith to which all is possibel. Your dear Mama came yesterday evening she is well and happy she expects you half in Europe

 Adieu with kisses yours J.G.
