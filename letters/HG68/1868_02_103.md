 <Calw 10 Febr 1868>*
Dear Frederic

To day as you see I am sparing paper; because I have but little to say. You have sent with David an immense ham it is very good papa eats every day twice of it, we boil a small piece of it at a time and eat I have also tried it; but it does not agree with me though I like it. Would you be so kind as to bring me 4 Ellen of the same Zeugle Jettle took for Aprons, pay it please and I shall return you the Gulden it costs,

You have I hope shirts enough till the midle of March.

Adieu dear son
 Yours J.G.
