 <C 26 Juli 68>*
Dear Paul

We were very glad to hear again from you, of you I had heard that God gives you grace to seek souls, that you are kind towards the younger ones, walking with them trying to bring them to the Lord, this testimony has rejoieced me greatly and I praise the Lord for His goodness and faithfulness to you, May He indeed use you to bring many to Himself. I was much rejoieced to hear through Mr Pretorieus that his son in Uhrach has been of late converted, How do you find Haering? his mother is very thankful for your love to him, she is a very fine woman, How is F. Muller?

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
