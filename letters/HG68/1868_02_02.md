Dear Frederic

Last week I did not write to you at least last friday. but as Jettle was there you heard through her all about us. the time is drowing near in which you shall be some days with us. Jettle will bring us I trust good news of you all.

To day papa had mission stunday in Church. few peopel, but the donations more than usual.

Zahn s Katerle got ill for 8 days got a little boy who lived two days only. the mother is doing pretty well. We are going D.V. next Tuesday to Nagold for a Mission s conference. Have you a good time? I mean as a poor sinner living from grace and praising God

Adieu dear Son. My love to all.
 Yours J.G.
