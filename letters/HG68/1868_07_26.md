Many thanks dear Children for your last of 30 June,

We say just like you how glad would we be to hear from Mama and Aunt Emma; but not a word, Tante is not well, Mama very busy with her two grandchildren beside the cares she has to give to tante Emma who cannot look after her household, Frederic and David though repeatedly asked to give us news of them seem to forget all.

I am glad that you feel something new in hearing of Hebich, his death is for me a new stir to go on confessing the Lord, neglecting no opportunity, to do it nor being shaken by fear of men, or wishing to please men which lays deep in my nature. The love of Jesus must constrain us to be able to use every occasion to speak of our Lords love, trying by all means to bring some souls to our Lord, and in order to do it well we have to pray much I mean often; for in us is no life; but have to drow out of His fulness. Abide in Him to bear fruit to the fathers glory. The Lord has given you grace to be small in your own eyes, it is a great grace, He will fill you with Himself and use you. To be free from the idia that we are some what, and can do something is the begining of possessing the secret which Paul had in saying I can do all things in my Lord who strengthen me, 
I just hear that Tante Ema is going to Boll

the news about Frederic will surprise and rejoice you. May God make of him a true servant of His, he is very nice

Many kisses to you four Julie Marie

 adieu dear Children Yours J.G.
