Dear Frederic

It is not very long since you left us, and still I fancy that it is long time. After you left I got work with wood and yesterday our visitors Mrs Zeller with Helfer Elsaeser and his wife, Mrs Maerle with a niece of her, With Mrs Zeller and Sophie Elseser I had joy He also is a nice man. 
To day papa preached after noon on I John 3, pity there were so few peopel, however if they had years to hear it may do much good. The love of Jesus is made known, but as long as peopel do not know and feel their sinfulness, they need no Saviour,

Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.

Tell us how is Tante Emma with love to her and all
