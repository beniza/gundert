 31 May <1868>*
Dear Frederic

We feel here the heat very much what will it be in Stutgart? We hoped for rain to day it looked so black all around us; but it passed away. We are glad to have dear Paul. I had half in mind to come this morning with him to salute you and return this evening; but as great many travel just to day it was thought better to stay at home.

How do you do? happy I trust I hope next sunday to be with you D.V. 
We are very sorry to hear that tante ist so unwohl.

 Adieu Yours J.G.

I do not think of going first to Olgastrasse but to Tante direct from the post. Love to all
 yours J.G.
