Dear Children

Mrs Strow from Bibelhause has just been here asked after you, had joy to see your photog with family, she send you hearty love, she always liked you. By your last I hear that you have written to Hermann Gross I trust that by this time you have got the shirts and that the two little dolls are amusing Julie and Marie. Lately we had again of the fine ham you have kindly sent. Paul did not eat of it on account of the homeopathy, which after all does not help much. We had a nice time during his stay here he is so thoughroully a man of God in all things that one can but admire and wonder at God s grace he lives from the word of life which he in like manner gives to others, David is still a Jew, reads but the old testament, speaks of God only he does not know the Saviour or does not want Him, I trust the Lord will soon let him see how poor he is with his selfrightiousness: and seek after the one which is alone valuabel before God. You have got it I trust and from thankfulness praise Him confessing His holy name before all and seek by all mean to bring some souls to His knowlege to be saved 
Adieu dear Children and Grand children
 Yours J.G.
