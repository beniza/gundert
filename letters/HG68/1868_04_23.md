 <23 April 68>*
Dear Frederic

I send you herewith three towels, they will do till after the mission feast when we shall then wash again.

Yesterday in hearing the great noise of the recrutes I thanked the Lord several times that you were redeemed from becoming a soldier, specially when I heard of Gothold Steiger saying to his mother after the examination I am a soldier, she had expected that he would be free; but not expect it be greanted afterward.

God has redeemed you and will make you free of all that which may still troubel you making you a true soldier of his for his service 
 adieu yours J.G.
