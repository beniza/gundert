Dear Paul

I trust that the caffee comes still in time and will last till you come to Calw, you will be so kind to bring me the tin box for caffee next time you come. The blue night shirts should also be changed every 15 days, the towels for your Caffee pot you may change every three weeks.

Papa wrote a letter on monday, the boys have it. from Marie good news, none from Samuel this time. This night papa will leave Bale and come tomorrow D.V

I hope that you have your pills by this time when you come here we shall try Omeopathy

Now Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
