 <Sept 68>*
Dear Paul

I have been in Stutgart a few days, David is nice; but told me again I do not love the Lord Jesus, I have not yet pardon this he told on my questions. He has some hope that during the feast days Christag he may get more light and blessing. may our dear Lord fulfil his wishes though He is not bound with feirtags or feasts.

All our peopel there were well. Charl and Caroline Wei√ü came with me in Calw, where they will spend some days,

Papa will speak to you about the pills, I hope we may try in spring the water cure for you, David is just like you and takes two pills every night. 
 Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
