Dear Frederic

Many thanks for the acquitung I wish a piece of the best and fine shirting you have now with the account sighned paid from our Money by Unkel Adolph. If the shirting should be dearer than for some weeks and you think it will become cheaper. then I would wait; but if not I would feel obliged to get it now by papa, you would kindly send it at the post when papa is to leave Stutgart so that he has it.

Heinrich Gross has sent me back the bedstead which he had from me 4 years ago; but there are no planks, "brett. has he forgotten them, or has the fuhrman lost them, or did I give none whent I gave the bedstead? I do not know. I pray you to inquire by Beringer whether they are still there. send me word by papa please pardon my troubling you
 Yours J.G.
