My dearest Frederic

We look anxiously for news from you although I know we can not get before a few weeks You are now at your post and perhaps somewhat perplexed or discouraged; but by looking to your Lord you get new courage and confidence, yea dear son be of good cheer our heimweh after you make us to pray more for you than for any one else. He who has taken you there will keep you and make you a blessing, be only small for your own eyes, afraid of self in that way we learn what the Lord meant by the words "hate our lives" renounce all that which we have, to follow Him. I must have no confidence in me allways less, for the experience teaches us after the word that with out the Lord we can do nothing Ah may He keep you watch over you! He does if you trust Him and not yourself or men. Keep reading Gods word faithfully and attend to prayer diligently, you shall then be well guided. 
Mrs Wirz sends you much love they both have much joy to hear of you and many other peopel here Mr Weitb too, all send you hearty love tomorrow we make our last zwetschken cooken we never had so much nor apfel, Adieu dear Son
 yours J.G.
