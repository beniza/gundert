Dearest Marie

Today we had again good news from you all except that you had a Catarrh, you seem to be happy when your house is full, for it one wants more strength than I have but it is true that you have less to do in house cares than we have here you have to comand and it is done in some way or other; when we have any one I must be before and behind because our girl is very slow.

So you keep your old Aya it is nice if she can help at school till she gets other work with the expected one Margueret will then have little to do, and you may rest more, We have the joye to have our two sons at home and David who should have returned already to day has been obliged to stay being unwell, I felt somewhat anxious at first as he bleeded so much throught the nose one could stop it but with vitriol, had fever and felt very weak, now after being three days here he feels himself better already. God will I trust bless body and soul in these few days together with Paul who looks very well, fat and staut.

Mrs. Wöhrle is still in Reutlingen assisting marie who with her new born son is going on well; Caroline Weiß wrote once that God is gracious to her; thought she has very hard moments, there are also good ones. Papa has got goodle from Gross Mama for we made none according to his strick order. Wishing you and yours much blessings in the coming new year, yea the blessings you stand in need of for body and soul with tender kisses to all of you I remain yours affectly
