Dear Frederic

I have the Key of the old box I found it in a drowr.

How did you come home and how is Tante Emma? to day thursday Mrs Wirz has sent to invite you to go to her, I shall soon go to hear what she wanted. 
Do not forget please to buy the homeopathy medecine for Paul, send them to me with your wash next Saturday, and tell me how much cost the three small bottles of Omeopathy.

I come from the garden, and my hand is trembling so I will not write more. We were glad to get a letter from you

 Love to all
 Adieu dear Frederic
 yours JG
