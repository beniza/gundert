Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, Würtemberg

 Calw viz Bale 29 Jun 68
My dear wife

At Carlsruhe I met Mglg, Strobel Müller etc all determined with Irion to drag me to the latter's house. So we staid there till 11 and went then on to Bale, where we lodge with Josenh. Only I leave the room at night to sleep with Müller and Bunz on acct of Mglg's usual determination to blow the trumpet unwittingly

Sunday I held the Martinstunde. Legrand then related at Christ's about the Worms affair. Mrs Anderson and Diez I have not seen as yet. There was the special Conference this morning which showed that Krapf thinks the Chrischona Mission ought to be given up and its pupils in future only to be prepared for the Inner Mission (America etc), but it is not sure if the people here (Jaeger etc) will agree with this view. Money seems to be scarce indeed and sickness common in India. Plebst will once more have to try Mang. if he does not get better before next hot season or the rains then return to Europe. So at least does Inspector seem to think. 
I keep this till to morrow evening and send you with this Uranie's letter which Nagel brought with the valuable contents. I wrote today to Miss Wallis and shall now wait to see what she will answer. Farewell for the present and love to all.
 Yours HGdt


30 Jun. No Indian letters as yet but I hope you are well. Fred has written a nice letter from Stuttg.

 Good bye
 Diez sends love
