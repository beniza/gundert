 <Calw 22 Mai 1868>*
1Dear Frederic

I suppose you need no more the warm blanket now? be so kind and send it me through David by Beisser, that I may have it washed, you shall get it again when cleansed.

I wish to all of you a good day at Kornthal If I could have seen much of you and David I would have come too; but I would scarsly see any thing of you, and besides we are to iron our wash on monday

 Adieu dear son.

Your papa puts already on the cap you gave him.

The tailors account I have paid. you need not care for it
