 Calw 5me March 1868
Dear Frederic

What can I wish you on your birthday except that which I wish for myself, which is an ear that can hear, and a will to be obedient to the spirit. these two things had the Lord richly and I feel I must have them too in order to live happy to the glory of God. We have so difficult to hear, therefore has the Lord said so often let him that has ear to hear, hear, 
I trust the poket hanker chiefs will be used by you with health of body soul and spirit.

May the Lord bless you keep you and make you a blessing

 With love Yours J.G.
