My dearest Marie

You last letter has rejoiced me much. Jea in Jesus we are to rest quietly, for our souls and for the work, we have not to care so much how much is done; but whether it is done in God seeking His approbation alone, men may talk what they will about our work we have to do with God alone and if no one should be converted during many years it does t matter. What is required from us is faithfulness, and love, God shall make the seed to grow <germer> in His own time sow only faithfully, perhaps if you were to see fruits of your labours too early you might be proud, and pleased with yourselves. Be of good chear, Our Lord did not see much fruits of His labours, wait patiently upon Him distrusting self. We are curious being the Lord knows it, to become as a child is a hard thing for us, wise and selfrightious peopel. Oh His long patience and long suffring to Him be praised who is not tired of us;

I was again in Stutgart and brought with me Caroline, she is I believe truly repenting, she has hard moments at night specially, she takes well what one has to tell her, and I trust it will be a reall work of God, she sees well that she was not right already in Hebichs time, but cheated herself with judging others too hard. I am glad she came to us, she works as much as she can which is necessary for her, she has done too little, before several of the others who were decieved with Caroline persist in their error and sing and pray the whole day full of joy, the devil has come in Engel of light, to decieve them. Miss Bourgard repents truly It is truly a fearful things to be so decieved, We feel anxious about Frederic having not heard from him We make no goodly this year papa does not like them 
Adieu dear children
 yours J.G.
