Dear Frederic

So all is settled our Lord has aranged beautifully for you, also for the journey and so that you shall still find our dear Emma Plebst in Mangalore which will be of a great value for you. It is to me very great and I trust of use to have seen how the Lord has managed the whole afair, it will also be for you a blessed and abiding lesson to trust the Lord fully, waiting upon Him, to talk of this is soon done; but realise it in deed is very great, to know and feel that we have to do with a living God. I have nothing to do for you, as in Bale you get all what you want; I trust I shall go with papa to the Mission feast. I shall have wash before it that your things may be ready to be sent to Bale, My love to all, my thanks to Unkel A adieu
 Yours [J.G.]
