1Dear Frederic

We returned home well and happy, found Jettle and Louise very busy cleaning about;

Please to send me with your wash 16 Yeards of the Zeugle I took for aprons, you have here a little bit of it2. I will make me a gown of it. Sunday I shall write about your wash when you are to send it next tuesday very likely. How are you and how are your peopel? Please tell Gross mama that I quite forgot to give her back the three creuzer I got from her in Felbach, I keep them till she comes to us in April


3Hast Du nichts auf Emilie Seegers Wunsch zu sagen? Bleibt es dabei, daß sie sich die Sache sonst wo in Stuttg kaufen soll? Ich sage nicht, daß Du was darin thun sollst, sondern möchte nur Bescheid haben. Mit Kuß Dein  V
