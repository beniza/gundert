Dear Children

In your last letter you tell us nothing of your health; so that we may conclude that the pain in your throat which made us somewhat anxious about you has passed away and you are free. All the news about Frederic and Marie you get of course abundantly from others. Paul will soon come for the vacation, which for us all a true joy. David seams to find in Gods word new treasores which he had not observed. I am very glad and thankful for this discovery after which he thirsts now, surely it is the means to grow in knowlege and grace, feed on the bread of life can not let us be lean and mager; but healthy and lifely.

Your two dear pets interest us much, all their speaches and ways. I send a tender kiss to them as well as to dear Christine and yourself  yours J.G.
