 <In Mt. Clemens 14 Jan. 69>*
My dear Children.

We were much pleased to hear again from you and family. and see that the Lord is gracious to you and revial Himself to you more and more, so that we feel fully united in the spirit, united with Him the head and among us His members, Your dear wife is probably busy making Christmas presents for her daughters, Were your two pets here or one of them we would have made goodle; but papa said this year we make nothing, it is true that Paul and David care little for goodle, and for other peopel to whom one should have given they get something more useful.

Our dear David comes with a sad heart still; however God knows how long he is to remain without peace and joy, because he cannot believe and as faith is a gift of God we can but pray that God would create faith in him. 
The peopel in the house send you love, specially Katherine and Annele. We have now found a new remedy for constipation, which is to make bread of fine wheat milled rather coarse leaving in the flour the bran this makes a sort of black hard bread excellent against constipation one puts in it no leven, only floul and water when the loaves are made rather small one leave them stay 4 or 5 hours and put them in the oven, the dough must be very ferm

I wish you a hapy new year in which we prepare ourselves for the coming of the Lord, meanwhile making you a blessing for many souls

With a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours J.G.
