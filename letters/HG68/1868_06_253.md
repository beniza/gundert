 Calw 25th June 1868
Dear Paul

Please send me your wash tomorrow friday 26. Is it soon enough to send you the Caffee with your wash in the begining of July on the 8th? Your pills I shall send D.V. through Knorr. We shall do our best for your friends. Papa is not here you know; but Knorr has friends here with whom he shall spend his time.

I am glad to hear that your health is good.

 With love
 Yours J.G.
