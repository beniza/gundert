Dear Frederic

Did you not feel on your birthday that great things were done for you? You appeared to me as the one saved at the 11th hour; for it was the last moment one could redeem you from being a soldier. I was very glad that papa had first the thought about it and was permitted to carry it on. We have joye in this being free; how much more should we feel thankful toward our Lord who has redeemed us from the wrath to come from the punishement deserved from hell, and condamnation, not only that but has made us children of God heirs of Eternal life, He did not pay our redemtion with gold or silver. His precious life His blood was wanted. Oh how should we love and praise. May God make this redemption very great before your eyes, so that you be filled thanks

 Adieu yours J.G.
