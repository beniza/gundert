Dear Children.

We have had no letter since we wrote you last, and I feel very desirous to hear what the Dr said about dear Christine Arm. I hope the Lord let you find the right remedy for her, In two days we are expecting Paul who shall be two or three days with us. could we but also see you for some days with your dear ones how glad would we be!

You will be surprised to hear of dear Hebichs departure, happy those who have believed and confessed their Lord as he did. Two things or graces I did admire in him, the way he could picture the Lord to the peopel, it was really beautiful to hear him speaking about our Lord, his great love and suffrings he could make so clear before the peopel and I doubt not that this picktured with much prayer was the might he brought so many to the Lord. He prayed much, paid no visit, made no walk without first pray, when he heard of some one coming to him, he quickly retired in his cabinet to pray, usually very short; but very often in the day it was his strength, then, He had no fear of men; he had to do with God alone without respect of persons, and therefore the Lord has honourd him much in converting so many to the Lord their God. May God make me and all our children such 
 With love to you all
 Yours J.G.
