My dearest Frederic

I quite forgot it was the day of writing still dont like the letters go without a word to my beloved Son, I am still with you in mind though I forgot to write.

Mrs Schauber who has died has left us money for the poor christians, so I joyfully go about making visits because I can also bring something. Still 8 days and we shall DV hear from you I do long after a word May our Lord bless you keep you and make you a blessing. Our dear David is still the same, it grieves me much, however I must believe for him God will work in His time. with a tender kiss
 Yours J.G.
