Dear Frederic

The news of Unkel about Mr Hebich have made us very sad. May God still leave Him some years!

Your wash has not yet come, please send it quickly.

I am glad that you shall soon see papa if it had been at an other time I would have liked to see both of you and would have passed a day with you both; but I cannot yet. afterward I trust
 Adieu yours J.G.
