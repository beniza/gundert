Dear Children

Last mail brought us no news and as the last letter of yours told us of your being unwell we feel of course anxious about you. we trust however God has spared your life, it may also be that a letter has been lost; we try naturally to quiet and comfort ourselves with many suppositions which however let us long after news from you.

Dear Christina will be disapointed about the shirts, I bought the shirting in spring it was then not so good as yet though much dearer papa and Frederic have of the same; but I am disapointed in it. but who knows how long one shall put them on, they may last longer than our life here. There are many signs which tell us the end is near.

The railways which are at work here bring us poverty and increases the price of victual as well as of lodgings, poor people are obliged to go out of Calw to live, finding no house here. All the news about our dear children you get richly from Jettle and papa, so I say nothing, also I have pain in the right hand from Rhumatism and can not write well. May you give us good news of you all. with a tender kiss to you four
 yours affectly J.G.

Might not dear Christine try fish oil trahn <Fischthran>1

the Lord be praised good news from you all specially Gods work in you, praise the Lord my soul.
