Dear Children

To day I have but one minute to write you a few lines; having ironed the whole day; and now a friend has come to sleep here.

If you try the homeopathy for dear Ch. you must not expect too soon to see succes it requires a long time when the evil is of old date. but patience will be rewarded I trust, that is we look on the blessing of our dear Lord. It is hard for us to trust Him more than the medecines.

Yesterday we had a visit from Mathilde Reichenecker who lived formerly in Grossmama house, she inquired after you all, she is a nice creature. she seams to have found the Lord too, her father and mother live still, she is at home with an other sister who like her loves the Lord too, 
I have but time to give a hearty kiss to my dear daughter my dear Julia and Marile.

forgive haste from
 Yours affectly J.G.
