Dear Frederic

These days you will learn more than in several years before, I mean learn to look to the Lord and wait upon Him, that is a great word, "wait upon Him" after one has praid to expect to wait, mean while learn to be prepared to accept Gods will though it should be against our own, for we are curious peopel, like that of Israâ€°l who said to the prophet pray for us we will do what the Lord says and when the Lord made known His will, they were displeased that it did not turn out according to their mind, in such things we learn to know our wicked hearts, and such expiriences are good, We learn much under them. Pray much and wait upon our Lord, should be our daily exercise, but we are at school and learn gradually. The Lord has patience with us He is of long suffring. I wish you peace quietness calmness in Jesus

 Yours affectly J.G.
