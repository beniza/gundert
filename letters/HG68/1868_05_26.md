My dear Frederic

Papa related me this morning how you spent one hour with him in his bed! I was very glad to hear all about you and David. I trust also God has given you a blessing of that sunday, and that you have often repeated with me, Oh God that I may like dear Hebich speak of thee freely* with love, without fear of men, using every opportunity - taking every moment out of thy fulness life and grace to communicate to others. He was really a man of prayer if we also pray often as he did we shall also get so much life that we may be a smell of life to many.

My wish and prayer is that all my children may be honnoured of God as he was, hated of the world; it belongs to it and an instrument of conversion for many.

I thank you for having sent me the small henkerchiefes though Grandmama. 
 Adieu dear son
 Yours J.G.
