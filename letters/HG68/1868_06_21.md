My dear Emma

First of all let me thank you for your kindness in sending me arrowroot. You have so many peopel to whom to send that you should not think of us, from every quarter the news sound as if you would soon return to Europe, for us I would be glad; but for the work very sorry. There are so few fit labourer that one can but grieve to see that just those who could do it best at least according to our feelings are to quit the fields. But God must know what He is doing and we are to be silent.

Sophie Elseser born Werner was here yesterday, she was expecting that by this time she would get a little one; from the moment she expected till now there were times of anxiety whether the hopes are founded, however the midwife assured it was so, at last after 7 or 8 month of expectation they find that they are disapointed, pretty hard lesson for both; but they are very nice, she is a sweet soul.

News about us and family you have from dear Mama who I know write you long letters. That David of late has been very zealous perhaps too much you will also have heard, but rather this than be dead or lukewarm, Frederic has spent 8 days with us, he grows gradually in the Lord, Paul continues steadfast by Gods grace, from Herman and family good new, He seams also to grow in His Lords grace, his two girls make him great joy. We would be glad could we see them all once here.

With hearty love and good wishes for your dear husband and self I remain  Yours J.G.
