My dear wife

Da sind wir. Two o'clock arrived and Nath received us at the terminus. No Eugenie as yet Mrs Anderson at Nyon will join at Geneve or Lyons Mr Braun very happy with his wife. Every body salutes you, such as Mrs Hager who gave us dinner. Emily's 5 apples were eaten before reaching Freiburg. "Have you one more?" said Frederick after having eaten two. Irion came with us as far as Appenweier on his way to the Alsace. Goodbye in great  haste Your Papa
