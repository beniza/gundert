My very dear Frederic

To day came your wellcome letter from Geneve it gave us a very great joy to hear so soon that the Lord had brought you so far well and happy, I am glad that Uranie could still see you, According to Emelie's account you will have embarked at 2 o'cl today and now at 5 we have a heavy storm, perhaps you have nothing of it.

20th Good morning dear son, we follow you day and night, there are few moments in which you are not in my mind and conversation, even Louise speaks always of you, yesterday during the storm she was in fear for you, and asked whether you have also good water to drink, for you drink a good deal; I then felt my wrong or forgetfulness I should have given you a bottle of sirup to mix in your water which is usually not good on board. Yea dearest Frederic we have good confidence that the Lord goes with you and will keep you fulfilling His promises to you, as long as you are small depending upon Him it will go well, we know that you trust Him and not self and your wish is to walk upright before Him therefore we have good confidence, we feel with you fully united in the spirit and therefore the home sickness catches me often, but I look to our Lord as you do too, I hope you had some sleep this first night on sea Emelie follows you too and sends love, the day after you had left came Gustele Wagner who regretted much, not to have seen you once more. I have seen her today, she wishes to read your pilgrims progress I will lend them to her, she sends you hearty love

no letter has come from you to day, we have been to Hirsau where Paul had a fine meeting on the first of John, the room was full, he showed how the Lord is the light which inlightes every man, invited the people to come to Jesus and take out of his fulness grace for grace, Papa is to day in NÃ¼rtingen so Paul has all his duty to fulfill even the evening meeting Mr Muller leaves gladly to him

21 no letters you will have come to Messina. 22 Your wellcome from Marseille came God be praised for his goodness to you all. A letter from Karachi Theodor not well Marie rather nervous, so we must wait on the Lord. So to day 23 les letters are to be sent you, therefor I must finish, how do I long to hear how you found yourselves on board as it was rather stormy after your letter from Marseille I trust Miss Greater has soon recovered herself and can injoye the voyage per sea,

So you are to get these lines in Palghout Give please my love to Samuel and Elisabeth I shall DV write next time May you my dearest Frederic have grace to come there with the Lord abide in Him, do nothing without Him He will guide you aright and according to the text of your departing day be with you in troubels, hear you help you out of it and honour you May God give you grace to believe all what you read make that precious word lifely or living in you so that you feel it is the bread of life and live by it, much hunger and thirst after it do I wish you as our Paul has now. with a tender hearty kiss
 yours J.G.
