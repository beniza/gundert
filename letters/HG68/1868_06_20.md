 <ca. 20 Juni 68>*
Dear Marie

Many thanks for your few lines I also write a very small bit as I hear that this time it will be heavy enough. I have spent one day <7 Juni 68>* in Stutgart, tante is again better and Gmama very well, with all the others, David very serious but nice some what under the law through the teaching of Leipold; but the Lord will guide David I think. for the present he thinks that he must be rejected of the modern Christians. he must appear to them as a fool etc. You speak of the Gross as bearers of the heavy cross, I believe that if they were bearers and followers of the Crusified Jesus Christ they would not have these so called heavy crosses. they are most honest and upright peopel; but for them and for their children they could not or would not be called in reality converted or pietists, leave the world, the midle way would or is too much for them. Mr Deimler is just with us, and I must say Adieu. Please give my love to dear Margaret I shall answer her kind letter an other time, your photog is very good. you look very well 
a kiss to each of you
 Yours JG
