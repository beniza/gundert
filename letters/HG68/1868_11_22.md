Dear Children.

Last week I was in Stutgart for one day only. I found G'mama and Tante Emma very well and happy, GMama has a little cough, but she makes as if all was well. I did not see many people, it was no time for it saw David, who does not care much for a visit from us, he is not yet right therefore continue to pray for him.

I write before we have a letter from you because we are to have a big wash and shall have no time more, your dear wife knows what is that to have a wash, sogar four women and in winter it is no spass! In America you have wash very often I hear every week or every two weeks, which is a nice plan! we wash every 6 weeks. The letters of Frederic give us much joy, he is so child like; we trust our Lord will use him to convert some souls and do good, for he has no good opinion of himself; but looks to the Lord, this is our strength the Lord can then do something with such ones. We have now already the winter, I trust dear Christine will not feel worse on account of the cold;

25 We have been waiting for letters from you; but in vain, yesterday I said Herman letter should come to day, not to morrow because of the wash, had it come we would have found time to hear it; Now I must say Adieu, my hand trembel from the cold water in our wash

Adieu dear children and grand daughters
 Yours J.G.
