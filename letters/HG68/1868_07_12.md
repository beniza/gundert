 Calw 12th July 1868
Dear Frederic.

This week will have been long for you in waiting what may be the Lords will, we are much with you in thoughts, and hope our dear Lord will bless this experience for your soul.

I have not the feeling that you shall have to leave us; but I may mistake, We shall be pleased with Gods will, however it may prove to be. 
Wishing you peace, quiet and calmness in God
 Yours J.G.
