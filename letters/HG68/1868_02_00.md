 <Febr 68>*
Dear Paul

You have I hope a good sunday. had you been to Hirsau you would have liked the subject, I heard but a little of it, because I had to pay visits before the meeting, that which I heard was about doing, working, executing, after having heard, the mean to be a lively christian is to work deeds, to act, provided we are settled on the Rock according to Matthew 7,24. Do you find it easy to speak of the Lord? I find difficult to tell the people about their state of mind about their wants of which they are not aware. Spare et still tell the truth so as to keep a good conscience is not easy. the love of Jesus and of the souls must mouve us to open the mouth and tell our mesage.

I hope you are well dear son according to body and soul. Hermans letter has given us joy.

So God willing we shall be together sunday and monday I am very glad that you can come to Stutgart I shall D.V. go already suterday in order to make some visits

Adieu a revoir
 ta J.G.
