Dear Frederic

Yesterday we were all in Bulach, on our return papa walked nearly the whole way by the heavy rain and he caught cold in sitting a little while by the side of the Kutcher. I trust the Lord will help this time as He has already a thausend times helped.

Are you tired of waiting dear Son? The Lord through this will do you much good, to us too.

How is Unkel Adolph? you wrote once that he was ill since that no news, has Samuel been baptised?

Love to all
 yours J.G.

I thank the Lord that He keeps you so quiet in waiting. Should you have to go it would be a token for me that it will go well.
