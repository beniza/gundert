Dear Frederic

By your last letter we felt that you were somewhat anxious, regarding what may still be required from you as soldier for your country. You are now at peace I trust since papa wrote you. and as for that which regard dear Unkel A. God will also care. all these cares are gradually setteld by our heavenly father. I said gradually in order that we learn to understand how we are to put all before Him small and great cares, yea put them with repeated prayers and confidence looking opon Him alone for help, these few experiences you have now to make will help you for the future, the secret of praying in truth, and waiting on God is a great acquisition. 
I wish you peace and rest in God
 yours J.G.
