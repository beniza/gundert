Dear Frederic

This morning sunday came your few lines, I hope you have a day of rest and blessing through Gods word which you can read with more leasure on sunday than on weekdays, next sunday we shall perhaps be with you. Today we went as usual to Hirsau. As I had two sick people to see there I came late to the meatingroom and heard papa only a quarter of an hour; but the subject was on the necessity of doing, not mearly knowing and injoying; but doing, working, the text was on the last verses of Matthai 7 The wise man who builds his house on the Rock. and the one who builds on sand. 
You bild yours on Jesus Christ the eckstone He is the foundation on which we have to stand and build up keep close to Him and you shall live and be huppy

 Adieu Yours J.G.
