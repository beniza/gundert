Deares Marie

Yours from Karachi came to day We grieve to hear that Theodor is not yet better and so nervous, however we trust and pray God to spare him if possibel. You understand that children can be idols without our being aware of it, it is often the case that not only children; but man or wife as others may be idols and God is a Jalous God in the old testament and in the new Jesus does not make Him otherwise, though I do not think that with you it was the case; but our heavenly fathers will must be good and right; so bowing before Him we say thy will be done, He has surely much blessings for you, when God give you an other one do not feed him with Goats milk and when or diarrhee come, put the child in a wet sheet surounded of a blanket make him perspire and bath him or rubb him well, papa has used this with much succes with all our children, you have seen it with Ch Scheffel. We grieve with you that that very dear babe has been taken from you; but it is God the only wise your father yea a tender father, We shall soon see the dear babe again the time is short, meanwhile let us pray for more love to Him who has loved us so very much. He deserves our love. May our dear Lord fill you with love and give you many spiritual children. Marie Buser with great many others send you their deep sympathy and hearty love, 
there is no room this time for a letter to dear Marguerit my sincere love and kisses to you all
 Yours JG
