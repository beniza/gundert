Dear Paul.

Your wash has come in time all right; but you forgot to change your night shirts, they are too dirty. You must change every 2 weeks or even more often and your socks twice a week. Now you soon come and we may speak of those things together did you not say that on the 25 March you come? Today I went to church; but understood little of the preaching our Decan is not simpel enough for me. I have nothing of his preaching. but in Hirsau God gave us a good word on Matthew 13.th chap 24-30 As soon as we sleep spiritually, the enemy comes and sows tares, therefore watch and pray. How is your health now?

Adieu dear Paul
 yours J.G.
