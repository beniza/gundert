 <Calw 6 April 1868>*
Dear Frederic

Only a few words to remind you that you should send me your wash saturday, perhaps yours and David will go in one box, or rather tow as you have several things to put in, so well from your house as from Tante the merredig. 
if Paul comes back with papa and yourself you may well take both boxes, we have wash on Monday or tuesday so that I must have your wash. 
So you are going to have papa again, and Paul I wish you the true joy  Yours J.G.
