 Calw first March 68
Dear Frederic

For 8 days we were with you how quickly the time passes, Today papa has preached in Stamheim the morning. Emelie and Jettle went with him. this afternoon, he went to Hirsau with Jettle. I have remained at home because I have toothache which I brought from Stutgart. I got a share of blessing at home by our morning prayer, papa has began to read again the old testament, so we had about the disobedience of our first parents. I thought a good deal about it, through disobedience we have lost the paradise and all hapiness and through the obedience of our Lord we get Eternal life.
