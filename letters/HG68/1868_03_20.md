 <20 Maerz 1868>*
Dear Frederic

I send you here the bill which you gave me please tell unkel Adolph to pay it from the monney he has from papa, I think he has about 200 fl from papa let him sighn the acquitung and return it to us in your next letter. 
The whole day I have been making visits.

Please when you put on your white shirts to take first the old ones you have there else they will become yellow so that they can not be washed well and the flanell ones which have been put on thought it were only a few days must be washed not keep them unwashed till next winter. I keep here shirts for you when you come

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
