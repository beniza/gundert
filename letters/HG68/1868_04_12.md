 <12 April 1868 Ostern>*
1Dearest Marie

Frederic has just finished his little note, he will have told you how heimlich we have been sitting together the whole day while papa with Jettle were in Stamheim where papa preached twice to day. I am glad I could have a talk with F who is I think nice, wishing really to grow and glorify His Lord. It is a pity that Paul is not here, that he went to Kroupenbach to preach you will have heard, he comes perhaps not back before Frederic returns to Stutgart

This week we have wash and cleaning, and the weather is like at Christmas at least a foot of snow on the fields, since three days it seases not to snow and it is pretty cold. You had perhaps your second son baptised to day, we long to have your description of him, the one of his papa we heard and like it, we would like to see the joy of Theodor and how he patronises Herman.

Take care what you are eating as long as you nurse, it depends much on the milk for a baby to be quiet and brave, I hope and wish that you may nurse long though it should be but once or twice a day.

I hope that dear Margarets health is better so that she can be at school the whole day.

There is a good deal of sickness among the peopel, since new year one has burried as many peopel as one does it usually in one year friday three to day again three have been burried, most strong and young peopel inflamations dysenterie and sudden death 1Mama muß der Frühlingsputzerei nachgehen und so ists aus mit weiterem Schreiben!
