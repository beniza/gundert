Dear Paul

I have given the pills to Mr. Knorr the Caffee I shall send you with your wash next week,

Papa went to Bale last saturday, till now no letter from India, perhaps they have been sent direct to Bale.

Mr Knorr did not come to us, the whole saturday we looked for him; but he went to Mr. Ross with the teacher from Tubingen, To day monday they paid us a visit I have invited them for the next time to come to us. 
We have much work during papa s absence

So I will tell you adieu
With love and best wishes
 yours J.G.

PS. You should change your night shirts and towels more often, and put two shirts in the week.
