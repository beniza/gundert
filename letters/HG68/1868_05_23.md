Dear Frederic

The tailors account I have paid, you have sent so great a present and now these 3 1/4 Yeard of cloth that I keep for me the tailors part. 
If you do not wish the cap Marie has sent you make a present of it to papa he might want it once.

Have you perhaps no night shirt that you have so few in the wash? I send you here by papa 2 and 2 serviettes Please put on the old shirts that they may not become too yellow by liyng long in the drows Adieu dear son  yours J Gund
