 <Sept 68>*
Dear Paul

I am glad that you found David pretty well the Lord will leave him I trust and soon get him out of that state in which he is not sure nor safe, should he remain long in it, it might become very dangerous,

We will continue to pray and believe. I rejoiece that tante Emma is so happy

 Adieu dear son
 yours J.G.
