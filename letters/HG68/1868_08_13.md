Dearest Marie

I must take the first minutes I have free to write you a few lines, for we had a goodeal to do these last days and shall have still, till the letters are to be sent. Jettle has gone to Stutg wednesday morning, since I had a big wash and to day, four peopel to dinnar Miss von Reutern with her brother in law and her two children, as addition to it came at four Pfarer Steutel with his wife, Mr Rose and wife, the two first are very nice Rose's wife too, she has more than him. To morrow to Tubingen, tuesday the sewing woman, wednesday iron, preparing a few things for dear Frede 
You know that since some time I have been wishing to become calm and quiet, I will tell you how the Lord helps me to it, my losung of Janu you have heard, The Lord has brought you to rest or given rest as I was one day thinking about calm and quietness, I drew the words, Sie werden sich verwundern und entsetzen uber alle dem guten und uber alle dem frieden, den ich Inen geben will. I had then great joy and thought long and often on that promise, At once my right arm which had been hurt by too much work or rather by taking up heavy books in cleaning the sale in April peined me much the pain increased so that I could scarsly keep any thing in hand with out pain, I than thought is that the rest promised? I than understood how God helps me to cut off the right arm and believed that if I would try really to do things quietly slowly, it would go, till then I had understood the word of the Lord about faith as doing wonders, for enstad to him that believe all is possibel, now I understand differently, by faith I can have the pain and praise God waiting quietly opon Him, it is like in Hebrew 11,35 not wonder to be deliverd; but suffered also by faith, It is really worse to suffer something in order to understand so Gods word and have it realised in onneself, I thought I would do nothing during our big wash alone as Jettle is in Stut and behold, the wash has gone nicely, we shall iron to morrow and I trust to be able to help as usual to day I have the sewing woman

Mathilda Reichenecker salutes you heartily she paid me a visit yesterday, she is very nice, she has found the Lord it appears
