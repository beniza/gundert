Dear Frederic

I trust that tomorrow we shall get a letter from you telling us much about Hebichs departure. we long to hear how were the last days and hours. 
Our dear GrandMama is already leaving us, because of tante Emma who is not well. We have again good news from Herman, the Lord be praised for taking such care of him and his family, one feels in his letters that he is growing in the knowlege of the Lord. but I feel one can rejoice only in trembling; for the devil trys all in his power, to make us to err not by loving the world; but in some way or other that we mistake the simpel way of His and have our own way imagining all along that we are in the very right way Oh de devil is very cunning, sly; therefore have we to say for us us and ours keep me keep us, watch over us in german the words "beschirme" is so nice. May our dear Lord beschirme you all.

I shall send your wash at the end of next week

Adieu dear son yours
 J.G.

Many thanks for your kind letter just recieved
