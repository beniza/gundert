Dearest Frederic

Your last letter has pleased me May God guide you farther et get he alone your whole heart.

You do not remember it seems that I gave you two <Preußische Thaler>* that is 3 Fl 30 with which you were to pay the tea and Mährrettich, So that I owe you now only 31 creuz which I pray dear Jettle to give you if she could not papa will send them; Tell dear Grandmama that I am very sorry she made us such an expensif present. She has trouble anough with us all and should spend no money. do not allow her to pay when you have to wash socks. Give my love to all
