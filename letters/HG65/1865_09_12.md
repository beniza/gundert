 <Calw 12 Septbr 1865.>*
Dear Frederic.

Sunday as all the Junglingsverrein was here I thought much of you and David; but of course it was the only frie time you had with Paul. there were together about 150 people, many went away before fesper, papa and helfel spoke after ward Ball, Steiger Doctor Verner he spock long and nice. Mr Roser red his report short and nice, we expected half Albert Isenberg! What papa said and the helfer Conrad can relate you he heard it but not the others I think. We had no one to dien with us as we took the Lordsuper with Marie for the last time we wished to be quiet, papa went to Stamheim after dinar for a mission Stunde and returned imidiatly after it, for we wished all as you can imagine to spend the little time it remaind still with Marie. It is hard to part from each others and still we comfort ourselves in the Lord He cares for us and will surely be with Marie

I long to see Paul if he could only believe in the Lord he would be happy, tell me how you did find him, could you speak to him of the Lord? 
He has just come our dear Paul I have much joy.

the few goodly you part for each other, I cannot put more in the box, with much love to you all. Also to the very dear Caroline much love. I will soon send her basket back I might have send it by Conrad but forgot it Adieu  yours J.G.
