 <Sept 65>*
Dear Frederic

Only a few lines to beg you with David to send your wash Kistchen on tuesday with the omnibus we have wash on wednesday, forget not to change your sheets, pillocase serviette, night shirt, tell David to do the same and send me all please. If you could tell me how many shirts are still with you clean I would like to know it

I had heard from Marie Monnard that Mr Spenett is a very fine man a true christian I do hope that his visit will be blessed for his poor neveu Leon. I am glad to hear your work is going on well and stands well. I think often of Tante Anna and Caroline give to both please my hearty love also to dear Mama and tante. We trust also that our dear Marie has safely arrived in Alexandria, in 8 or 10 days we may get a letter from her. Pray for Paul love to my dear David I would have liked to mend his Juppe. He should tell me what he wants for the winter

 Adieu Sons
 Yours J. Gundert
