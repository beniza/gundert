My dear Frederic

I trust the news of the death of the Ephorus B.<aumlein>* has made you to pray the more for our dear Paul, that God would not let pass this wonderful death without converting him it would be really sad if nothing would be worked on his mind and upon many others. Our dear dear Paul could he but believe, and not refuse all the invitations God makes him.

Maries letter will have given you much joy as it has given us too. by this time she will be perhaps in Heidrabad, the two nex letters will still be very interesting. for we shall get I trust much news about all those places and persons where we were. To day Seifried was in the meating at Hirsau he looks really very nice although he suffers more than formerly, he has much palpitation of heart and uneasiness since 2 or 3 weeks,

How are our good people in Stutg. Gundert, Weiss, Isenberg? is Tante Anna well, give her my love and to tante Caroline, It will soon be Christmass! Mrs Scheffel is going to Stut. She might perhaps bring back the bag for P, you will perhaps see her by Steinkopf where she is

Adieu dear Frederic
 Yours J.G
