My dear Frederic,

Papa wrote you yesterday; but I had just gone out to see Mrs. Steiger who is better thanks to God

About your cloth to be mended send them when ever you like the sooner the better. Your dirty clothes are to be sent next Tuesday 21. As you have no box you shall make a paquet of them with a liste of course, If the Omnibus should not be there, you would then send them per post.

Mari's letter will have given you joy; but the next one shall still more after her arrival in Madras.

That Samuel can remain in Cannanore gives me joy and thanks to the Lord, 
Dear Son still a few weeks and we shall be together D.V.

My love to all in your house
 Yours affectly Julie Gundert

I hope you send me two night Shirts if not three, also two or three towels 
Give my love to Mama and thanks for her invitation but I like to remain at home
