Dearest Frederic

Pardon me that I have not soonner sent you these letters of papa and Marie; but I forgot or did not think of it. I have a great joy with Paul he is so lovely and aimiable. I think he has more from God than he shows. the letters I send you will give you joy and dear papa whom we expect today monday will soon write himself for he is more diligent than I am. Your letter has given me joy dear son, the Lord be praised for his love and kindness to you. My hearty love to all at Stutgart.

When are you going to your new home, I would like to go to put your things in your new almira in good order, but you will do it well enough. perhaps I may soon visit you once and see the new couple in their nice house. 
May God give you much joy and thankfullness.

Pardon haste from
 your J Gun
