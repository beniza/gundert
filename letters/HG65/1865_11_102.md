 <Calw 10 Nov 65>*
Dear Frederic

I thank you for your last letters, they give me joy, I am very glad that you like music it is for you a fine passetemps which otherwise might be ennuyeux during the time you are free. I wish David would also like it; but it may come afterward, and he knows how to spend his time.

I thank the Lord that you find yourself so at home there and that the Lord blesses the means of grace you have which are indeed very abundant. It is to me greatest comfort to know the Lord has began his work in you and he carries it on He will also perform it to his glory; we have only to be small for our own eyes and depend fully on Him He will guide us well. Oh may the Lord soon begin also so a work in our dear Paul I hope you pray for him?

Mrs Steiger is ill since 8 days, the Dr says that it is poorness of blood, she is weak and has pains in her limbs, Some of her little ones spend the days with us that the mother may have some rest.

Today at two O'Clock shall Mr DÃ¶rtenbach be burried. he has been 8 weeks ill. the last days were very painful.

 Love to all with a kiss
 yours J. Gundert
