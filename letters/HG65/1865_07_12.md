 <12 Juli>* [1865]
Dear Frederic

Here with a pair of trawsers I have no pieces more to mend them an other time and the Wirzes have nothing like it; but I trust the trawsers may still last this summer as they are, the other I shall send with your wash next wenesday 19th perhaps you are much in want of your wash but we could not have it sooner, It is a pity that you forgot to send me the dirty things you have still by you, when I saw the paquet yesterday which you sent I said "that is right Frederic sends his wash just at time" but I was mistaken. however we shall not wait so long to have the next wash. first because of Marie.

Dear Sohn I have read your letter and see all the different feelings which fill your soul the time is comming I trust in which you will be able to controle your feeling and thoughts better. I hope that with Tante Anna you will have less occation to irritation and excitement. the good Lord has began his work in you and will not leave it, but you must pray more frequently you know the Lord ordered praying and watching as mittle <means>* to keep us. use these mittles often in a day than Gods presence will surround you

Adieu lieber Frederic be of good chear
 your Mama J. G.
