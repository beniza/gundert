If you still put on your Juppe and would rather have it made after some weeks it is quite equal to me, for one can have it made then just as well. Adieu love to all your dear people in the upper and nieder logi A propos now that you have a new bed I would pray you to wash your feet very often that the bed does not get dirty. I do it every week it is good for health and cleaness
