 <3 Nov 65>*
Dear Frederic

Many thanks for <the>* two last, I was very glad to see <that>* you came home happily and in good time and specially that you found yourself quite at home by the dear people.

It is indeed a great dâ€šlusion of many of our church people to think that through baptisem they are converted or can through it obtain admission to the kingdom of God, that <is>* a reason that the people live so securely and die without fears although they have not been born again by which alone admission to heaven is given to us, that's to say, true faith works in us a new life through the Spirit of God. - If David would bring you his dirty cloth every week and your Carpet bag would be too small I might send you a <wash>* box if you like? Does the Strow sack in which came your mattras belong to grosMama? forget not to inquire where Tante or mama buy the good soap, I do not want it now

 Adieu love to all
 yours J.G.
