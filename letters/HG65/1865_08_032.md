Dear Frederic

A few words only to show you that you are not forgotten and though you would not see it you feel it I hope for you know that several times in the day one puts you before the Lord who alone can keep you and also teach you how you are to walk and deal. As you have been saying in your last letter about your work I would only remind you that you have probably the very best place you could have. You know that you were not pleased with Winkler because you did not learn, there was too little opportunity for it, so now you have much to learn according to your wish, and you know dear Son, one cannot teach young people without some severity, Do you remember what you felt here with those who were under you, Carl Degenhart and the nopping Madele would say "der Herrn Frederic is so b√∂se" dear son do not think I make you a reproche no I only try to help you to see that you have it better in Stutgart than many thausends else where. What I beg you specially dear Frederic is never to speak a word against your masters before your two other companions, you would lose all controle over yourself, make among yourselves the thing worse, and after ward one has to repent.

I long to see you towards the end of the month, it seems to me a long time I have not seen you with David. Here it is cold and raining. how is Grand Mama Ask Caroline and Anna whether they will not come to us we are alone and wish they would spend some time with us. With love to you all  Yours J.G.
