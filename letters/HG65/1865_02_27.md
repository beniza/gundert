Dearest Marie

Why will you return from Stutgart so soon, we can do our wash without you or instead of having it on the 3d we may have it the week afterward, I wonder you stayed so short at Tubing and Reitlingen, you need not hurry so much.

Give my love to dear Mama and Tante inquire much after their health, they both had fever. According to Frederics letter Adolph comes tomorrow or wednesday; but he will not be long here I suppose.

Frederic and David are to send me their wash on the first or second of March. I wish you grace and wisdom for the work you have at Stutgart 
Love to all yours J. Gundert

tell Frederic not to forget his sheets and pillowcase

<Herzliche Grüße von Deinem V.>1
