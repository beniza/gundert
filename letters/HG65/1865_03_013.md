Dearest Frederic

your letter recieved today has given me much joy, especially to see that you begin to distrust yourself and trust the Lord who will surely carry on his work in you till Christ be formed in you. be of good cheer only believe, the devil will try what he can to disturb you but remember it is the lot of all the children of God, the devil is angry that they leave him leave his kingdom. Oh dear Son you are a happy man that God takes such care of you, he has called you to be a partaker of his glory one day, now you learn to believe him to rejoice in him, also to die to self this is the hardest work; but we are not left alone. as soon as the Lord fills our hearts with joy and peace we gladly give up every thing yea renounce ourselves saying I must decrease and he must increase, away with my old man. May the Lord give you much hunger and thirst after his holy word, yesterday at Hirsau papa spoke about this how we should feed on the word of life, you would have liked to hear,

May God give you a good measure of his spirit also the spirit of prayer and suplication with thanks givings We have much reason to thank and praise God who loves us so much Oh could we see and believe that we are so much beloved we would always be filled with joy and trust fully our good Lord who means always well with us, whatever the devil and our wicked heart may say, the continual tendency of the heart is unbelieve therefore against this have we to fight.

Adieu my dearerst Frederic love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
