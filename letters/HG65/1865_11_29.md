My dear Frederic

I trust your wash comes in time that you have had till now of the old one. I have put your wollene Socks in a bag, you should always leave them in it that the insects do not eat them up. I hope you trawsers have come to you and that you can still put them on. I send you no drows; because I have none we shall speak on the subject when you come at Christmas it is but four weeks more. Dear Frederic I did not mean that you should change you socks les often if you have enough, it is certainly far better that they be not too dirty. I will try to make you still a few pairs of wollene and if you should want some between the wash you can send them in a paquet through David.

I râ€šjoice that dear Tante Caroline understand you so well, how are the two young gentlemen? do they play at all Pardon dear Son that I send you no goodle in your box; but first their is no room and secondly no goodly. love is better than bonbons no? Adieu my very dear Freddy love to all  Yours JG

Your Socks are in David's box because I had not room in your own 
have you among your wollen Socks one black pair?
