Dear Frederic

So it may still pass some time before you come to your new home it is all for good; when things in the beginning are difficult after ward it is often better than when they go smoothly according to our wishes. Our dear cousin Paul mohl brings you a rock <coat> of papa which you may perhaps put on during the time one would put a warm futter in your juppe. I have tried here to buy one all ready but none are to be had. So I think the best would be you send me your juppe you had from Mr Wirtz which you have put on to go out this summer I will have it lined with warm cloth and it might serve you as a home juppe for this winter then next year we shall make some thing else for you to go out do you not think this is the best we can do? 
I am glad you have a good time I wish you many blessings. Paul has left us to day I am sad about him we have much to pray for him. <Er war aber ganz lieb.>1 Paul Mohl has given us joy, you will like I think to speak with him. Miss Kern the cousine of Jette has been here a few days, she returns to Stutgard with Jette who will see her Aunt and soon return, please tell her how much cost the meerredich.

Adieu my dearest Frederic I think often of you. my love to dear David to Grand mama, Tante to all the dear people.

 With love yours J. Gundert
