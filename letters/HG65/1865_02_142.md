Dearest Frederic

Your last letter has pleased me well, the Lord be praised for his faithfulness and love towards you. be of good cheer He will carry on his work in you, be only obedient to his spirit and feed on the word of life. The old papa Wirz goes every morning to his children above and inquires very kindly how they are, he has been ill has taken medecine he is better, but still somewhat afraid he may get an atack "a Schlag" he is very tender to Mrs. W, the young often the morning he says I could not sleep in my room my wife snore "schnarchen".

Give my hearty thanks to Mama for her love and care during the time you were unwell also for mending your trawsers, she should let somebody do it and pay for it, My love also to dear Tante ask from me how is er side whether she has no "Stechen" and how are her fingers which have the gout or Gicht? tell her that I think often of her and wish her much inward joy in the Lord, as a reward.

Adieu my very dear Frederic
 Yours J. Gundert
