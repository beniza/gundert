My dear Frederic

Your last letter has done me good. The Lord be praised for his love and kindness to you. It is indeed a great joy for us to know that you are under the guidance and discipline of the Spirit, He is the right one to make us obedient, because He not only shows what is wanting that in which we grieve God and men; but He gives us the strength to fight and even makes us chearful when we have to give up our will and die to self. this no man can do, therefore we must sick above all to be to be guided by the Spirit being obedient to him and to the word. Please give my hearty thanks to Tante for the grapes she has kindly sent us. next tuesday 24th send us your dirty wash you and David in one box. Your both sheets pillowcase and all. we have wash on the 25th forget not, tell it to David I shall be happy to see you as you have told Jette you would come; but let you guide in this also by God

in haste yours
 J. Gundert
