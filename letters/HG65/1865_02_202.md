1Dearest Frederic.

Uncle Adolph has brought the news of you all. I trust that by this time you are reconciled with Tante and Sandresky. Dearest Son how can you pray for the poor young man if you have not a feeling of pity with him rather than to feel angry and wexed. Make it a task now to pray for him and think that it is pure grace if you are not like him, and think also that others may find in you many things displeasing, though they are of a different set they may be no less painful. When you are displeased with any person or thing you let every one round you feel it, your face, temperd, words all is different, we have felt it often here, and where ever you have been this ill humour I know, and am still now and then troubled with it; I know that it can only be over comed by prayer and faith, as soon as you can see your self in Gods light and be sure that it is evil before God. you will then pray et soon feel that God helps you to overcome yourself. God loves us as we are, he has pity with us, So are we to do with our fellow creatures, As soon as we can pray for those who are desagreable to us love grows in our hearts for them with pity

Dearest Frederic be not offended with me. The Wirzes are all well My love to all in Stutg
