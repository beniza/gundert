1Dear Frederic

Your box of dirty cloth has arrived. Since I read your letter in Deutsch I have much more joy to hear from you. It would have been very nice if you had been here with Paul, we were together to Stamheim and Zafelstein. He is very thin poor Paul and does not look well at all although he says that he is well! It is already long since I saw the Würzes. He is in Berlin with Fritz Wöhrle We have many visits friends who pass bey. 2Eben kommt Fräulein Buser, daher Mama nicht schließen kann.
