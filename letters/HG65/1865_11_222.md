Dear Frederic

David forgot to give you the wash he had still Yours came all right; In winter you might perhaps use only two pairs of stockings in the week I fear they will not reach. The other things are all right The trawser you have sent to be mended are made of very bad cloth. I think it must have been old Stuff or very bad Wool; for they tear every where, they will not weare many months longer.

Are they small and short? please answer me these two questions. I do not write more because I have no time just now Adieu dear Son
 Yours JG

1Dear Frederic.

I think a bag like the one of papa costs much money and it would be too small, rather an other sort, something like yours; but finer and smaller After you have found out some thing for D let us know. Give also my love and hearty thanks to Tante Caroline. I am very thankful to God that He has so wonderfully cared for you in every way May He also bless and reward those who are so kind to you, Also dear Hebich who I am sure prays for you give him my love.
 Yours J. Gundert
