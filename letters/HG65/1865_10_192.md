Dear Frederic

I think you should keep your pillow, because you will find the others very hot specially in summer. You may have one from Anna and your own: keep also the four pillowcases you have and your sheets, if tante Emma tells you after ward that you do not want them you can always send them back. 
I also think that you would do well to send your things by the Omnibus he cares better than Beiser, you have not many things your plumeau, Matras and blanket, you might also keep the blanket, the bedstead and strawsack belong to GrandMama. You may put the plumeau and Matrass in a Sheet and give it so to Bauer in the Omnibus. the green box you may leave by Grossmama or send it the plumon would go in it. I would like to put your things in order by the dear Weiss.

Adieu dearest Freddy
 Yours J.G.
