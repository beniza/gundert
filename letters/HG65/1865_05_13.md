 <13 Mai 65.>*
Dear Frederic

I could not put every things in your box it remains here three shirts of David and two night shirts of you both with you stockings which we will bring when we shall come to Stutgart. You have sent me no sheets to be washed so I return you none, an other time please put in your box a list of the things you sent us to be washed. David should do it too, to write a list might perhaps remind you of the sheets of you bed wich should be changed

Paul who has more to do than you both sends always a list and forgets not sheets and night shirts but changes them often

My two sons in Stutgart will learn bye and bye I trust I shall be glad to see you soon, may God give us some blessings when we come together - it is a pity that Mr. Hebich shall not be there Please dear Frederic give my thanks to dear Mrs Isenberg for a lamp broche she has kindly sent me, Marie will pay it when she comes with us to Stutgart In two weeks D.V. we shall be together,

My love to David to Grand Mama Tante and all the dear people there 
Adieu May God keep you and bless you
 Yours J.G.
