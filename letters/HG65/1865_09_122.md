 <12 Sept 65>*

Dearest Marie

I trust you had a good day and that the Lord was with you as he has been with us here, and the whole day we have been cleaning the books, dear Paul came at 2 oc and has helped us till this evening. I had much joy to see him he is so good and aimiable, no more so thin his cheeks are fuller Poor Emelie S. walk about like a shadow with tears continually in her eyes, We have been thinking and speaking much of you both, Frederic and David have written both to comfort me Frederic specially David requires much details how you went, how it was, how you were and papa!

by the letter of Mrs. Fetzer you see that she send you a spoon and forck for Salad, black wood with silver on the handels like our little ones <knives>; but the spoon came here broken just in the middle of the handel. I send to Harr to see whether it could be mended; but he said it was impossible one must make a new handle, so we keep it here and may I trust have an occasion once to send them to you after repaired dearest Marie pardon so short a note but I know that if I only tell you that Good has been gracious and near us to comfort us you will be satisfied. I wait for good news from. And may our God and father be continually with you. his presence follow you, and go before you Adieu Be of good chear you serve a good Lord 
peace and joy yours affectly
 J. Gundert
