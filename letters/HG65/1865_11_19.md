My dear Frederic

Your wash is I trust coming on tuesday 21 A propos. Do you know what David would like for his Christmass? if not you might inquire without his knowing that you tell us this secret, I thought of an Umbrella for him; but if you know something else tell me. Paul wants a traveling bag not too large, some what strong, GrossMama might perhaps give you an advice where to buy it a little smaller than the one you have for your dirty cloth, and finer perhaps of leather You must pay it I will send you the money only that GrossMama sees that it be good and useful for Paul when he comes for his vacance. You are as well as we waiting for news from Marie.

Mrs Steiger is better, her feet still paining and weak, Papa preaches to day, the Altar is covered with fruit and flowers as I have not yet seen, most beautifully adorned. Tomorrow monday, papa Jettle Emelie Seger are going to Liebenzell at the Conference I perhaps to Newhengstadt to see Frau Pfarer who is still ill, I see you sitting befor the piano playing learning. when it is difficult and will not come right you sigh and pray, no? Oh dear Frederic what happy people we are that we dare tell every thing to our God. you are happy is it not? Adieu my sweet Freddy, love to your whole house
 Yours J.G
