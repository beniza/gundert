 [Mai 1881]

Many thanks dear David for the Abricots I shall pay them to dear Marie when she comes with Wille.

Last week there were some in Calw just for the same price but not so good and this week none were to be got.

I am very glad to have them for the present.

With much love to you three
 Yours affectly JG.

As soon as I sent a paquet your box shall be return
