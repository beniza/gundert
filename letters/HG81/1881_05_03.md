 <3/V. 81>*

Got Your card and thank for news. Was at Heilbr with Jet Isbg, saw and heard confirm of Thod and the catechis. in the afternoon. Charles much edified with the splendid dinner in which _________________________ was credenced. We heard good news from B. (also at Heilbr.). I met in Zuff Josenh who was going to Leonbg to see his very sick sister Weitbr and told him that presents from Ind Christians waited upon him. They had first intended to send him a coffin of Sandalwood, but were persuaded to think of something else. However it touched the old Insp. He had been at Gr Bottw. for a feast after having worked hard for 4 days on occasion of his Umzug. I found Ma really better, still cough going on. I intend to come the 10th. I never hear what became of the Scotch Miss Record for El. Weitbr. I could have given it here to Mrs Sch or her son repeatedly. When read I want it returned.
 Goodbye Yrs w* kisses.
