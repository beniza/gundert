Lieber D[avid]

Joh hat einen schlechten Tag mit headache and does not intend to come today. I saw him only at breakfast, he had slept very little and continued after drinking his milk, with how much luck I do not know as yet I arrived well, my Bhaltis was not very graciously received by Angersche. - Septuages and Sex might perhaps be improved by adding "ungefähr" (der 70ste und 60ste Tag). Sir Walter Elliot will come to Wildbad and visit us, old Indian strong in archaeology etc. Nothing new from Emma. Mama pretty well, up and doing - Goodbye M W and all
