My dear Children [Hermann]

I was exceedingly glad to hear that you could not come to Europe this Autom; I would have been very sorry for dear Tine if you had left for winter. for a voyage on sea at this season is dangerous, After I had head* Marie had written to you I felt very uneasy, and thought papa should send you a Telegram; but as he did not think it nessesery I prayed earnestly God would direct your mind on that subject and keep you from accepting such an offer for it would have been a terrible charge for dear Tine. It made me more uneasy because I had written you not long before that to make it in reallity the wish to come to Europe, So now I thank the Lord to have led you as He has done it. Surely He will show you the right time to come and send the right person to replace you for the time of Absence

I am truly sory to hear that your dear Julia has so many young children in her classe it is too much for a young teacher such a trial of patience I wish her something else and hope the Lord will relieve her of that task. David' wife has been here with Wille, he is a fine boy; very lively and quick in his mouvements, She is delicate; and should care more for her health; but young people like long walks and society, so they must learn You have seen little of David and may be astonished at many little things. 
We were all much rejoiced to hear that your dear baby is so well, how much we would like to see you all; I thank dear Tine for the sacrifice she would have made if you would have gone.

With much love to dear Mama to your dear children

With kisses
 Yours affectionate J. G.

Best love from Uranie who speaks often of you

I am glad Frederic wrote to you he is a good man and George is but a man of business it seams
