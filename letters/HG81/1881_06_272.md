 <27/6/81>*
Dear F.

1.) to thank you for H's letter which came all in a hurry and gave us joy 2.) to announce that Ma is quite well for her circumstances. The heat in coming was fearful, but here we sleep with open window had also a good rain after our arrival and feel well. Ma came by Hotto to the house and Johny walked with me, seeing us from afar coming the 2 children "carrassed" to meet us. Marulla smiled graciously to receive us with her wont friendliness. She can sit very quietly in a corner of the sopha and see us eat. Heard a sermon from our Diez's brother, the Austrian editor of sermons, saw the people invited for Caff‚ - WE. with wife the 2 br Hoch and Paul's wife with her mother. Wir ließen die Verlobten leben etc. Afterwds Martinstunde and in the garden of Carl Sarasin with a choice assembly - cards shown that invited; last year 7 silver spoons disappeared where ladies had given tea to thirsty Miss[ion]friends! I write this Monday morng before Spec. Cfce and conclude with love to all
