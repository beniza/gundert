Lieber D[avid]

Could you perhaps invite dear G Müller (at Marquardts I suppose) to speak here one evening? Saturday, Sunday, Monday etc he has only to chose for the day. I of course go to Herrenbg where I have to preach and speak, but others would be glad to have him. He may decide when he can and we shall try to make it public

 Goodbye Yrs P
