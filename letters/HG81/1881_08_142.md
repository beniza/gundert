 Calw 14 August <81>*
Dear Marie [Hesse]

You have had a hard time; and made the experience how gracious is the Lord, and shows as if He would through the many trails only increase our faith and confidence, telling us in our ears "you see how I can help; it is more difficult for me to care the inward, to take away those sins and misery over which you morn and sigh for delivrance than to cure the body" I have heard His voice you will have heard it too therefore good courage, He sits at the fournaise and cleanse carefully purificing faith from imagination and all the mixtures which surround it.

We hope that Pauline <Haller>* has found the home where the Lord will also find her, may the Lord give you patience and love, surely I have good hope that John and yourself are the personnes for her.

In a fourtnight Uranie shall be with you I think Frederic is to fetch her at the end of this month, so that on Saturday 27 she is with F to come to Bale remain the sunday and monday come to Calw We are glad to have so often good news from you and John, to Adele and Hermanle kisses
 Yours affectly J. G.
