 <27 July 81>*
Dear Marie [Hesse]

I was grieved to hear that the old peins came again I had hoped they had passed not to return. It is right to seek a person to help you, I hope you shall find a propre one, Let us know as soon as you hear from Mrs. Hauff the letter of Adele has pleased every one, It is good that Hermanle can be with the boys, and your dear Marile will have felt her Mama being unwell, happily that she is so good.

Be of good chear dear Marie, the Lord does beyond ours prayers and wishes, only we have to learn and to wait, that He heard you when you cried must give you courage to seize his promises.

Adieu my dear Child

Your children are very merry and happy,
with kisses
 yours affect JG.

Our Neibour Schmied Bätzner is dying as a believer in the Lord, the visites of Rösle Kappler were blessed for his soul, when she died he wept as a child, so the Lord knows houw to get His elects out of the world. 
The children shall remain with us till monday, not to meet Georg in Stutgart
