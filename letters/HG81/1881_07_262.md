Lieber D[avid]

Fried telegraphirt daß er heute (26) Nacht ankommt, von Jagstfeld - gestern noch in Liegnitz. I keep the things for him that he see all before sending off. I hope G. has come back. He told Str some time ago, that he is in intercourse with a noble Lady, Str congratulated him for it because he thought it most conducive to his spiritual health! What stories! It would of course be much better if G had found somebody that undertakes to support and guide him in future, but this is too good to be expected. - M has written that she is better (suddenly ______ passed). She is in treaty with Hauffs in Nufr about takg a young girl as help (not _____) in the family, perhaps a _______. If that should not succeed, does any one know of somebody else. Say for a year to help each other mutually. Mrs Reinhdt has lost it seems a girl by a similar heartdisease as Herm's Tine. - Joh arrived Tuesday at Reval, sees nothing like grief about the state of things, got his books through. Hoped to be 11th at Weissenstein (11th = 23d it seems). Goodbye with much love
 Your F
