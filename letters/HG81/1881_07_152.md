Dear D

I do not think that you shd go to NB for the night, it gives trouble to the good people. Rather go early Sunday morning and pass the day with them. Here you may also see us at leisure Mama is pretty well, I getting rid slowly of Schusshexe. Good bye for the present. Fred hopes to catch John on his way to Lüb. somewhere. Send me also back or bring the letters of Herm and Gust
 Yr F.
