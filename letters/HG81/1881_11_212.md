My dear children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last letter and for the photogra of dear Julia which is very nice and I think and hope that she is still nicer in reality, that is, if I could talk with her I would find her more freindly and humble then she looks in her picture. We are very glad to have her and I beg that when you come you bring us your three other daughters we wish much to have their photograph. Julia look so strong and stout that it is a real pleasure to look at her, and how is looking dear Mama now?

These days we have much pleasure to have with us our dear brother Theodor from Barmen, one feels how he has grown in the Lord during the time of trial and ilness in his famely. he is thankful for all and tells his people they should thank God much more also for the little begining of health which takes place in Elisabeth after so long an ilness It is indeed that which makes us happy to be able to thank and be chearful in the Lord. As soon as we can be thankful we have the victory over the enemy and our wiked ungreatful nature, in Gods words there is so much about Gratitude and joy, these two go together a thankful heart is joyful. Paul says to be joyful is our surety. he was in prison when he wrote those exortations to the Phillipiens, so afflictions and troubles should not deprive us of that joy in our Lord who has promised us the victory; but fight we must your dear Julia will also learn that self must be overcome, shes has already begun with her many children and teachers I send her much love as also to dear Mama et sisters, Uranie joins in true love

 With hearty kisses Yours affectly J G.
