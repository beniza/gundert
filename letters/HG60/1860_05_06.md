 Calw 6 May <60>*
My dear girl

Herewith only a short Selam and the assurance that your letters have been very welcome, but your face will be more so. You have this feeling perhaps in a stronger degree, as my letters appeared to you so strong, that my presence looked very mild or weak in comparison. Now tremble and see how you will find me! When I see you I can talk a long while and put in lenient words - palliatives and explanatives - whereas in writing I just pursue my aim in short steps. That makes the difference - but if you come I will amply apologize for all that has been de trop and say you have put to shame all my expectations about you. Emma will at once be put into the 2d place and you will be the Maedle, not one of the two. A whole room I fear you will not get, but room in a room - and you will not be made a Governess but may give lessons and acquire a name etc - but above all things* you will find the Lord here too and peace in Him

Farewell for the present
 Your Pa
