 <Maerz 1860>*
My very dear three sons Freddy, Paul, David

You do not care much for letters I dare say since you have the hope to see us after some months. Papa has told you that you must get a good testimony of Mr Moeret in order to be able to come to Calw, of course you will do your best I am sure, not only to be permitted to go to Calw; but by nobler motif, the very one to please us as well as your teachers in which case you get greatest joy that is Gods abrobation and blessing It would not do well for you dear sons to get away with a bad conscience.

I am very glad to hear that you like Mr. Hebich and wish also to be converted with Gods Grace it shall be done; if two parties agree on point it must come to pass, God has already said yes the three little Gunderts are mine Papa and Mama gave them to me at their birth I will that they be mine; but will they come to me? Now you say yes we will. Yes with God's grace to day every one of you must say yes I will, now I begin with God's grace. If you have indeed such mind God will make all right for you

Dear boys I long to see you how good is the Lord to bring us together again. I only regret that we leave here so late, but faith is wanted to bear with it as well as patience. Now dear sons with kisses to you and to your dear brothers H and S. I remain
 your Mama
 Julie Gundert
