My dear sister

I want not to tell you? Nonsense: I want to tell you, but I need not, that your letter made? rather gave me great joy. But I will never give you thank for it, but always thanks. A promise is never very nice fulfilled but always nicely: though fulfilled it is nicer than unfulfilled. I fully believe you, when you say, we will have great joy to see you: I trust your intention is good, but when it will be realized, and you suppose this to be very likely, you better say we shall - My health can never be well, only good - but I may be well, though I am also good, as every one can testify who has looked into my heart and has found out its goodness under the black covering, which it seems does generally hide the inward treasure. - I have seen Mr Widmann: and talked about the stipend to be obtained for Paul Mohl. When I hear more about the conditions under which it is granted, I shall write more at large to aunt Mary

Meanwhile farewell
 Love to all
 Your brother H

I may see Miss Baeumlein with her at Teinach this afternoon. Jette talks of returning to Stuttg on Monday.
