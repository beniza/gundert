Liebe Jette

I am very glad to hear that you are forced to become English beyond what you had imagined. You will know that Webster is a Weber, and that you are a spinster oder eine Spinnerin: so I hope they may be enabled to weave something out of what you are spinning for them.

I do not see why you are to be bothered about Augustus' income. 4'000,000 Louisdor's is as I take it something like œ 12'000,000 of the present day - a very poor income for any great empire, though I do not think that any such statements allow of a correct verification: Any how the sum will appear big enough to any child. Take my Paul for an instance! How much he longs to be a Millionaire and what does he not all intend to do with the Million when he has got it. He is quite sure it is inexhaustible in every sense. David protests most loudly against any and every project of making him a preacher He might become a prelate, if that could be done immediately after finishing his studies but stand upon a pulpit? Never if he can help it! Now farewell und Grüße an Deine liebe Mutter und Dich von Deinem  H.G.

No news from Bale, at least none of any interest
