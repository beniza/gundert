Liebe Jette

Your English is excellent beyond all my conception. There are some errata, perhaps mere slips of the pen as f.i. thougt (ght) sais - says RÃ¼ckenmark is spinal marrow - "could be <by?> engaged with" might be affected. - Depending, as she did, upon her sister, not from! though of course this is against the etymological meaning of the word. "At her passage" rather: when passing through. An English passage is something long. It may indeed also signify a sentence of greater or lesser length, but a traveller's passage lasts from one shore of the ocean to the other. Makes a good impression on me, rather than to me, or gives me a g. i. Sooner become German? grow to be a German, certainly rather become a G. - could be a good teacher? might be. all that she will say - all she is going to say to good an opinion - too g. explain me - to me! I shall not be wearied with such corrections. For you see I am already in the way of correcting proofsheets and it makes one feel rather grand to find one point after the other, in which others are still below the level one's self has attained to! Now you have Julie to talk to you - she is not a correct writer, but a fluent talker if not speaker, and so I hope you will put up with her for a season!
 Yours affectly
