My Beloved Tantele

Accept my best thanks for your kind letter, it is indeed very kind of you to write so often, but above all accept a thousand thanks vor the two books you have so kindly sent me by which I hope to profit. I had a real joy with dear Jette I only regret the time was so short.

I will not write you much my sweet Tantele, because, you get all the news by our dear Papa. I trust and have the proofs by your letters that you go quicker in English than I do in German, Every day I see new difficulties and some times am almost ready to give up learning!

When I wrote you that our children were better than formerly I did not mean to say there were a beginning of perfection. Oh not so far. You will have occasion to judge of it when they comme to Stutgard, they already speak of that happy day when they shall of course try to be good and polite for it will be easy to be such, they will get so many good things and you know good things and sweet make one good too. Sad truth! However by God's grace we are truly happy and the dear pets are pretty good and contented. 
My dear Tantele I must say Adieu. With love to all our dear Friends also to Miss Seckendorff she will by and by speak more of her Saviour than of Miss* Trudel, one must bear with people who are easily exited the Lord bears with them as with the quiet and calm ones

A tender kiss from your
 Julie G.
