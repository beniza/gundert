Frau Gundert

 B. 5 July 60
My dear wife

I got your letter with the Tüb. enclosures. Many thanks. Glad that you used the stick. I hope the boys have profited wonderfully. It seems we shall leave Wilferdingen on Monday 2.15 P.M. so we may be with you for supper soon after 7. Yesterday Insp's annual report increase in India during 1859: souls 300, in Africa 160 which appears well enough. In the afternoon the new Missionhouse inaugurated by many speeches. Hoch spoke yesterday forenoon, and Mader from Africa. I have seen the Weigle's and talked Mal with the C Müller's, who are very affectionate as well as the others. Mrs Hoernle also here, and Mrs Fuchs. Dined with Christ Sarasin, where the Reihlen's are from Stuttg. Hope Mr Gruner is going on tolerably well. More guests this year than ever before. Also Rev Mr Schweizer of Gültlingen. We - that is I and the 2 sons - meet but little, there is so much to be done, seen and spoken. But I have had a full conversation with H and hope by the blessing of God he pushes on - tho' slowly

No letters from Corcelles or Vevey. I bring some postmarks to dear David, whether any letters from the Kinderhaus remains to be seen. My love to the boys and I shall tenderly whip them if they do not obey you But hope that will not be necessary. I hope dear Emma is not wasting away by homesickness etc. I saw the brides of Kittel and Kaund, who had met Marie 
 Farewell
 your H.G.
