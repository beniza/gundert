1My dear husband

I know you will be thankful that the Lord brought us as far as this - We could not go round the Cape it was too late the ship too loaded, we alone with a Captain who is said to be drinking as we got back our passage money we went up to Bombay and went by steamer - D.V. I shall relate you all when we meet. - The Lord be praised who gave us friends on the way and helped us so much By* my letter to the boys you* ...2 that I wanted to go to you direct and I wanted to know your mind about it all - But it cannot be I hope you will think it right that we spend a few days here then we need not come again to see our friends - The Lord has helped us wonderfully we shall have much to tell you when we meet

Now adieu to yourself and our dear people
 Yours affectly
 Julie Gundert
