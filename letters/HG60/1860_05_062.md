<Herrn Dr H. Gundert>1s wife on her way to Calw.

 Calw 6 May <1860>*
My dear wife

It is quite a new thing to write again to you. The last time I did it in Engld (it could not reach you) once to Bomb may have come to hand. - I am so glad you came the short way after all your transactions - and hope I shall hear how it was brought about! God knows what it is for - certainly it would have been a long cessation of all intercourse.

Now I hope you have not come too early but can stand the cool in the mornings and I wish you quite to act as you find best. Perhaps you have come by way of Geneva and Neuchatel - if not you may visit at least Corcelles and Vevey if you like - but a little rapidly and then come to Calw. I hope to meet you at Wilferdingen when I know the day. Also Sutter may come to see you if you write to him
 31 Amalienstrasse Carlsruhe
You would only take the train to Carlsruhe and embark after more than an hour's stay, to be in 1/2 hour at Wilferd. From there 3 or 4 hours drive to Calw. All of course waiting anxiously to see you. Now do all as you think best and may God bless you with our 2 boys. In His love
 Your H.

P.S. I had long thought whether you would not take Müller's Carl into our new house but Mr Meuret it seems would rather keep him, and the family make already a hubbub about the children. But if you think Müller would like it, try to thread the needle - should you think it right and proper.
