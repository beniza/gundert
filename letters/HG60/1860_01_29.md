 January 29th /60
My dear Paul.

It is some years now since I wrote a letter to you and I think you will have quite forgotten me, though you were nearly six years old when you left India, Today the 29th January is your 11th birthday, dear child I cannot believe that you are already so old. And now I hope, you will be able to understand this letter and also recollect a little about India, I hope you are quite well, and also learning diligently It is a very long time since I heard anything about you and Freddy and David, I hope you will write me a small letter, Give my love and kisses to dear Frederic and David, and tell them, that I have not forgotten them, but think often of them, - You will now be full of joy, I think, in having your Papa and Mama always in Europe, I am also very glad for you,

As the request after stamps is not yet over, I send here some, 4 for each of you,

May the Lord bless you and make you His child,

With affectionate love and kisses
 Yours affetly,
 M Will.
