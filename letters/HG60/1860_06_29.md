 first July

Dear papa

A few minutes after you had left the boys brough two letters, this one of Pauline and one from Marie who has seen Mrs Irion the news she got from her you may here in Basel her husband is not strong will likely come next year he does not go well with the younger brethren, Strobel goes to Cannanore and Herre to P. From 8 to 11 O clock it poured down by torent almost like in India, the roades were filled with water I hope you have not been hurt by the rain, The children are tolerably good. Frederic not yet right in his stomach

I have waited till to day the first July to send you this thinking that some more letters might come for you. We are thank God all well. the children pretty good having seen that I can also give the stick if wanted. It is still raining and very cold Dear Emma teaches faithfully piano to the two little ones and we take the best of our time to teach each other. 
As the Decan or Fisher are to preach to day I stay at home where I get good enough by my Bible. I hope you are tolerably and have a good time with our sons! to whom I send love as well as to our other friends. Mr Kruhner1 is as Usual

Adieu Dear papa
 Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
