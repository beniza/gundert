My dear Hermann and Samuel

I write but a few lines as I trust to have soon the joy of seing you here, were it not so I would indeed try to tell my mind to dear Hermann. Lately as I was reading in the Epistles of John I was struckt to observe what a stress is laid on brotherly love as a sign of having passed from death to life, if we have none other this one at least we must have and if our heart comdem us in this respect woe to us God is greater than our heart and He sees that it goes wrong with us more than we understand or fancy to be. 
You are right dear son it must become some what new with you, or rather you must become a new man, and such new creatures we cannot become without digging to our selves, now to die is not easy, not natural to us at all, and God will not force his work with in us, there must be in us a true desire to take up the cross and walk in the narrow way.

Dear Sons how hard has the dear Lord with us I understand it more since I am with our dear little ones, how grieved I am when I see them so intent to have their will done, and so is my God if I cannot give up my will fully to Him - and learn daily again aferter my Lord to say not what I will but thy will,

Adieu my dear sons in the hope to see you soon.

 Your affectionate Mama J. Gundert
