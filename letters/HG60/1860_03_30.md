My dear Freddy and David

Many thanks for yours of the 14th February, just recieved, Give also my thanks to dear papa for his; I am as anxious to be with you as you are to see us, it is good of the Lord to bring us together again, of course I cannot promise how tender I shall be with you, to indulge you too much would be a sin therefore the Lord will keep me from it; and I know that if you have a mind to be good children we shall be very happy together; What joy that will be to take a walk together the evenings. I hope my dear Paul profits much by the book papa gave him which he reads so diligently I send him a kiss also to his brothers Herman and Samuel, to you both of course, Lydia is much pleased to get your Salam she returns one too.

Well my sweet dear sons in four month please God we shall see each other. You also know that many ships are lost at sea therefore pray the Lord to keep us and bring us safe to you

 your affectionate Mama
