 27. <Juni 1879>*
My dear

Today (27) received John's and Mar's letter for wh[ich] many thanks. One for jet came at the same time which I tried to bring her in person, but found the bird flown out. Went then to Mama H<och>* but could not see her, she had a bad night and is now laid up with fever. No wonder. At 2 PM yesterday we flowed together about her. At 3 the procession was arranged D and M first, I and Pauline to follow (we did it slowly enough) then the other pairs. I did the needful after singing and then we again filled the carriages and went to the Casino where the dinner had been ordered. At times I sat, also walked with her in the garden, or jet was about her. From 5 to 9 we dined, interruptg the operation with plays in the garden when Fred ran and frisked about as he had not done for 20 years. There was a good deal of poetry read, hymns sung, toasts given, altogether too much of excitement for an invalide; when she left I also went home with Fred. John's telegr made joy, it was not the only one. I slept well and could only have wished to give half of it to P. D and M left this morning for Luzern, Frd for Schaffh. I did some writing till the evening when I ventured out as stated above and return havg only seen Theoph and Willie Good bye!
