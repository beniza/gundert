Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind Carte and for one of dear Jettle. Yesterday I asked the children to spend the afternoon with me, so that we could together be in thoughts and talk with you. We were glad to hear that dear Mama Hoch was pretty well and hope that the rest will help to her getting better, please give her much love.

I go every day to see the children Marie is pretty well, cannot walk well, Emma very busy, would however come every day if I was not going myself. Liesele not quite good humoured, Adele goes with her papa in the forest to spend some hours.

One Carte from Burgdorf sais that Uranie came safe and very happy, they all rejoice in the hope to see you when you fetch Uranie. I saw the Schn√ºrle, she suffers much from headach, the baby has bad eyes, red, inflamed, but a good patient boy. Deuschle is still with the Zahn, In our house all as usual. today it is very hot, the new couple will not have walked much it is too hot, where did they intend to go?

Mr Mogling wrote a kind note According to this letter of Mr. Stoten the children will be disapointed not to go home this year as it appears. It is good they are in Kornthal Pardon my not writin more

 With much love
 Yours affectly
 JG.
