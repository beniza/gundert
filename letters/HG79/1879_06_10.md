The coupons for Frederic are in the Bureau in the sitting room at the right hand a small drowr is first taken away than behind are all the papers. We have nothing to write as Uranie did it two weeks ago, much love please. Here with the letter to Marie Monnard, if Marie can add a few lines good if not please send it to Marie in Rolle. So you had work for Sir Robinson <war 9 Juni in Calw>*, and wrote us two notes many thanks, Much love when you write to Samuel we rejoice and praise God with them for His gift of an Agnes, So no milk and little sugar, Frederic with the Miss H have done us great pleasure, I am glad to hear that dear Jettle shall go to Bale she should go till Canton de Vaud

Adieu love to all
