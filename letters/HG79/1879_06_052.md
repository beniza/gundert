Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind letter and the one of dear Jettle, it is always a joy to hear from you, and that dear Adele is better how glad for her mothers sake too, much love to them all, as well as in Steinhaus, If Frederic would come on the day which we are to leave this instead of a sunday it would be nice; we might return with him at any time he likes that would be in the 17. or 18th, but if he will rather on a Sunday come he may do as he will, perhaps also we may meet John in P on his return from Baden, I am glad that Stammheim Christine is so far well as to help, she should have wine and not most tell this please to our Christine with love to both of them dear Jettle knows what I mean. Love to the madle above and down to Weitb It is today very hot almost oppressif, we were a moment in the garden, but were glad to come again in our room.

When you write to the children give them our kind love, I hope dear John is getting courage, and new strength The Lord is gracious and helps me to look over the high wals or over the darkness which surrounds me. What a great grace it is to be able to believe and trust fully the Lord.

Uranie sends much love and I with a kiss to you and dear Jettle  Yours affly
 JG.

Frederic sa chere femme et enfans des baisers et salut aux quatre soeurs en haut.
