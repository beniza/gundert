Frau Dr Gundert, Calw, WÃ¼rtemberg

 <1 Septbr 1879>*

I arrived here well, at 6 o'clock. Yesterday I had a good number of brethren with me who had been at Jacoble's burial. Here I found Mglg with wife and Herm. He had never received Anderson's answer, therefore could not advise us. But And. arrived here this morning in the Missionhouse, lookg as well as a. 67, and relating about all the fds, also Col Young who does not come to Bale. When John arrives he will have to put up with me at Schuscha and I have already received for him a little book of sermons to be criticized, they are by a Russian. This afternoon we are invited into K Sarasin's garden. I met a "Katharine" who wants to be remembered very heartily to Mama Hoch. She wd not tell more of her name, but stopped me on the street to inquire after her health. Good bye to all
 Your H
