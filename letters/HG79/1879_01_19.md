My dear Children [Hermann]

Again a few lines from me, there <they>* are the first since I am up, <(seit der Krankheit 18-20 Dec. 1879)>* The Lord has been very good to me, has taught me many lessons, which have created many prayers and sighs. May the Lord who has shown me or made me to feel deeper my great wants and shortcoming, disobedience fulfil all the desires and sighs, which came before Him. I had surely lost the first love and felt often, condemned and reprouved; Now I can only say Lord work in me! Give the love, which enables one to live for Jesus, serving confessing His name joyfully. 
I thought much of Mary who sitting at Jesus feet having heard gave Him that which was most precious; <to?>* hear well makes to take and give. My will I have to give papa spoke lately of the Lord, how he gave His will, and would nothing but the father's will. to find always Gods will good agreable and perfect requires (as written) to be renewed in the spirit of understanding; but with me it goes slowly!

now I must tell adieu with most hearty love to my dear Tine and the three dear children.

May the Lord guide you, where you are to go.

 Yours affectly
 JG.
