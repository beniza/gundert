My dear Children [Hermann]

So you are still in Mont Clem if such is the will of the Lord May He give you souls instead of monney and rest which you have renounced It was very Gracious of the Lord to give you such peace and rest in Him during the transaction which took place during the time of undecision, It is good that your dear Tini was of the same mind as yourself, Children like changing it it is natural.

Frederic has perhaps told you that Uranie gives to each of our Children 2000 Mrk they are with Frederic with the interest of 4 per Cent it is for the Vereinhaus; but you may have them when you wish it. You have only to thank Uranie when you write; She sends you much love, she likes much to have your letters translated to her, she is much nicer than formerly; also her health is better, Love from me to my dear Tine to your three dear Girls with a kiss yours
 affectionate JG.
