Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind letter, and all the news. I hope you have a good day at Altensteig. It has rained the all morning that has perhaps hindered Frederic to come; if he would like to see Dr Verner on account of his hand he would find him here on tuesday next.

If I have not mentioned something about sleeping is not that I have not to praise, for I sleep thank God very well and feel truly better; but I must avoid all fatigue of any kind, and thank God that I can do it 
Here a long letter from Miss Jorand, Uranie will write one of these days to them and send it per Calw perhaps that Marie will had a few lines 
 With love to all
 Yours affectionate
 J G.
