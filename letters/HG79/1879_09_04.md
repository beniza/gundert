 Bale 4 Sept 79
My dear

Just now about 9 PM your telegram reached me I am sorry to say that I cannot come in time to be present at dear Br. Weitbrecht's burial. I have not heard from Uranie and am fearful to put her into trouble and confusion. Nor am I well enough to travel by night as I came here. I was for two days miserable and do not think it right now to venture anything. Hence I shall try to meet her as agreed upon Saturday morning and reach Calw about 6 P.M. 
It is painful for you to excuse my absence, but I am sure enough the dear Weitbrecht's will excuse me when I do what I think best under the circumstances May the Lord give them richly the consolations they stand in need of and let them feel also the sympathy of Christian friends, whether present or absent. My best love to Mrs. Scheffel and Elise, and may you all be comforted from above by experiencing that the Lord is present and does make up for all!

 With true love from both
 of us Yours affly
 HG.
