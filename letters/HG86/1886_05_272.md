Herrn J. Hesse bei Frau Gundert, Staefa, Cant. ZÃ¼rich

 [27 Mai 1886]
Dear children,

I just now (27 M) got a letter from Ch<arles>* in Bl<aubeuren>* who seems in good spirits and you appear to be also to have completed your cure. Now only I discover that I must change the address. Yesterday I went to St found Dav returned from Leipz and well, also Paul and Mar. looking well. It happened to be Emilie's birthday, there I dined and accompanied them to their garden. On the way I saw Davy's house shining over from the opposite mountain side. Th came too with aunt and Pl's, we had some reading and enjoyed also a short rain that fell. Sister Jettch who accompanied me in going and coming could not have the slight operation she wished for performed on her (encysted tumour on forehead). She saw more of Th than I, found him still overtaxing his own powers, but tired of St masters and longing for a change (to Carlsr. it seems). To me he looked radiant, up there in the gardenhouse which however he soon left for some lesson or study. Ernst has announced himself and wife for Saturd. Nothing from Amer. this week. Ch. ist preparing for an Elias performance. Give also my love to your hostess Fr. and Nat and may you find all well on your return to B.  Yr F.
