An Herrn J. Hesse, Heinrichsbad, bei Winkeln1, Canton Appenzell 
 <7 Mai 86>*
Dear John

Your cards came both in time; the Bible report has not yet arrived but I shall send it I hope next Sunday. Tomorrow we expect Carl who has promised to walk here, to repeat the feat he undertook many years ago, tomorrow. We heard much about him through the sister of his Repetent Imm. Gros, who had taken great interest in him and considered him as a sort of firewheel amongst his comrades. I hope he unburthens himself a little, but I shall not press him. We had a quiet week so far after the bustle of 1 May. With much sympathy we heard about your experiences and hope the alvus* does not trouble you now. There is a talk here that our king has had a stroke of some kind at Nizza but the papers are silent. 2 Drs are said to have gone from St. to Italy. Dav. has been infected it seems by his Daul with something like diphtheritis; his house has now a roof on. The little boy has been bathed and the fever seems gone. Much love from all. Jul and Lisele went yesterday to Leonbg. We greet you and Joh. G. and wish you happy days. With kiss f.[ather]
