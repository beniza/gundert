Dear M.

We were very glad to hear of your being better tho' it seems you write in bed. Jet has today gone to K after she had with me witnessed the joy of Oe's children in seeking their Easter hare a most lively scene. I had today the satisfaction of being good for something: a Norsk letter, application of a young schoolmaster with good testimonials for reception in the M. house, to be sent as Miss[ionar]y to China, had to be translated. Did jet tell of a Japanese who is since 10 days in the house? Have not yet seen him, nor did Graf come; perhaps he has vacation like some others. The sick brother Bader is improving, his mother who knows all about Held, living near Dinglingen, dines generally with us. Goodfriday evening I greeted Christine, Mrs Ammann and Cockburn, the latter will visit me. I have not yet left the Miss. house for any visit, nor seen the good people here. I hope yourself and Mrs. S. are feeling the fine weather, I work generally with open windows, but the work itself is wearisome and tries my small store of patience

 Good bye to all with love yr F.
