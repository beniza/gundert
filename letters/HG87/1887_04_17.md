Herrn Missionar J. Hesse, Calw, Würtemberg

 B. 17 Apr 87
Dear John,

You needn't fear my coming for your sake, there is a person nearer to me than even you whose benefit I have in view. I feel that for the present I have done enough here and that a change is indicated in this season. The Childr's leaf is almost all done, except there be yet any extracts from Emma K's letters to be inserted. But I must have a good bath and other comforts in the accustomed way. For the remainder of the work here I must chose another time. Besides invitations are commencing to trouble me and the throat is not yet free. But why enlarge on the old man's wants. He must be permitted to be homesick at times and longing after his folk. Genl Goddard (John G.) sent a money order to the post for 1 œ to aid the dear Mission "If you apply for it you will get it." Let dear Eddy cash it! Stach wrote a letter to Herm so tell him if he is a good boy he may get it Tuesday after 3 PM. With God's blessing we shall come home safely. I have also the particulars about Akem. Plenty love to all
 Your affect F.
