Dear F.

We travelled safely, arrived 7.10 When I took jet to Miss. house I discovered that she had planned staying here rather than going to K<ober>* Miss Gr.<uner>* accommodated her near me. My postcard of Sunday had not arrived, but rooms were ready, I in Shamachi jet next neighbour. I gave the 2100 to Mr E who promised a receipt, Mrs E<nsinger?>* reproached me not to have visited her rooms for 13 years. With Oe. I take the coffee afternoon and pass the evening; breakfast and dine with Miss Gr. commenced work in right earnest whilst j. made visits at K etc. See as few people as possible. No stove heating, windows open half the day, all well; but what a fearful vista of protocoll books etc Röm greeted very heartily Goodbye to all  Your F.
