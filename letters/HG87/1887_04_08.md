Dear John and Davy

This morning Goodfrid I received your note, glad to hear of some amendment of health, but grieved for dear Mary. Jet was today with K's, I worked on, but heard this evening Oe. explaining the last verses of Is. LIII in the Bibelstunde. Easterevening I am to hold it. When it was over, Christine came to greet me, Mrs Cockb. Pfleid. Amm. etc good people plenty. I have as yet only passed one evening with Pfist and the boys, saw them sup and heard the Inthought. Dear people here, also Miss Reutern. The prospects of Cam. Miss. bright enough, Christllr's descriptions most amusing. He knows to sketch the men and things, f. i. the Gov. who uses many expressions for his subjects of which Schweinebande is perhaps the mildest. None of the students was with me. With Oe. there were already Kinzl and Röm. to join in drinking Coffee. Now Pfleid is to come also I have not yet left the compd. Goodbye

 In much love Your F
