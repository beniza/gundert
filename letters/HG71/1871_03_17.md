 Calw 17th March 71
 <R 18/19>*
My dearest Frederic

You will have been much disappointed in expectation of the parcel from Calw through Miss Busser, With the best will one could not have sent things to you, the fotograph of dear Paul if it had been ready; but till now, no going forward. the Gentleman who makes them has it seems very much to do. So my dear son you and ourselves have to learn patience, We have been some what unwell and are thankful that it is better, I am again troubling you with a letter for Tante Uranie, who is not well.

How is your health? you wish for more work could your health bear it; for soul and spirit I think it would be good, but you feel your self how it is. Do you take your fish oil and have you still boils?

In my mind I am still much with dear Paul, it is a tye which drows us above, and probably we shall also soon have overcome and see that which we believe and for which we fight.

David seems to be nice and to follow the Lord, may we all of us follow Him fully, no dear Freddy we are happy only when we have the feeling that indeed we follow Him leaving Him all that which concerns us, it is somethings very sweet to be abel to put all our cares on Him with the assurance all is right with Him, then we must not help He does better alone than with our help, for He will have the glory of having done the whole, and thats due to Him,

Write us how you are and believe that we love you dearly

 Now Adieu Yours J.G.
