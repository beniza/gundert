 Calw 16 Febr 71
My dear wife

You will have heard that Marie arrived safely with the bavas, who had a good night's rest. We on the contrary got up early, breakfasted at 6, and when we dined, the work was not yet finished, such a tremendous wash it was, owing to the addition of the children's things and your protegee's inability in doing much. Anna arrived yesterday at 4 o'clock and got a scolding from Jettle, but was afterwds busy enough. My walk I took today with Thodo alone, the others were occupied with hanging the things. I hope all has terminated well. Decan I hear is to be at Heilbronn on 16 March. 
On Sunday there is to be an investiture at Ostelsheim, and as Grill has to preach he asked me to have a Miss[ionar]y meeting. So this comes just before the Pforzh. duty on Wednesday next. I shall try and come from Pforzh on Wednesday evening to Stuttg and be with you this day a week (Thursday). Sooner I can hardly manage except there be some urgency. Plenty love from all and may grace uphold you in your task and make it easy by rays of the future glory once to be revealed in the Saints of Christ!

 With a kiss Your HG
