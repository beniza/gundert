My Dear Elisabeth.

I was very glad to hear by the last letter of Samuel that you were pretty well, also glad to hear that Major Sweet <Tom Stanes!!>* is so kind to you, is Mrs S nice with you? how many children has she? she is a suppose a pattern of Muthers and house keeping, are not her children kept in beautiful order? Please give her my love; but especially to the dear Hodges and Mrs. Groves, where is her Jesse? is the son a good man?

I had much joy to see your dear mother and sisters, the first had a good day; but it seems that the headache is increasing, so that one has some fears for her eyes; but she was joyful and happy when I saw her last. 
I hope that your Ellene is getting some more energy on the hills, she has also opportunity to see other children which may be good for her. Samuel spoke as if you would ride does it not give you palpitations. 
All the news about Paul and David you get from my husband. We were glad to see Frederic who looks pretty well

With true love to you both I remain
 Yours J.G.
