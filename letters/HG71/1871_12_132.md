My dear Children

Many thanks for your letter and all the news it contains about your family. I am very glad to hear that dear Tinne is so much better in every respects; may the Lord so bless the means that she be fully restored to health. 
It must be a great joy for you that the children are learning so diligently, I hope that you may find some one who will teach her music; untill her grandpapa may teach her, and Unkel Frederic who likes music too. Our future is in our father's hand and He will guide all things right, how good it is to have such a father who cares much more than an earthly father, we scarsly believe it. how happy could we allways be if we were like children in deed, such confidence and assurence believing fully and allowing us to be led by our Lord Wishing to every one of you a happy Christmas and new year With a tender kiss in hope we shall see each other once more in this world  I remain yours J.G.
