1Dear Jettle

You have done me a great pleasure to send me appels I thought of it; but would not tell it, Pardon also that I have not written you direct, but … la lettre I find no time by my dear Paul. Papa will tell you all about him. We are to wait; it is painful to see his red cheeks and to hear the dry cough troubling him almost continually.

Your dear Aunt seems to be pretty quiet when I tell her to believe and accept the free salvation made for her, she says "yes; but obey and follow is now my taske I know and feel that" she spoke to tante Emma about taking an other logi and live in it with a friend whom she knows well; but I dare say you know all about; If she had not rhumatism just now she would be quite well.

Please give my love to all the dear friends name by name. Helfer Schmid has paid us a visit, they asked much after the Würz, how is it? Steiger, Dorle. G.

If you have once an opportunity please send me a few pair of stockings cotton ones white and gray just as it come the woollen ones are thather warm; but I am in no hurry
