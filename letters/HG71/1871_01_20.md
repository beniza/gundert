 Calw 20 Jan. 71
My dear wife

I am sorry the nights of dear Paul are so restless. Poor fellow, I fear he must be very dejected, and yet the Lord is good and hears all the cries that are sent up to Him. He will surely answer the petitions and do what is good for us all and will elicit eternal praises from our hard hearts. 
I am quite well again, walked yesterday with Marie on the slippery road. In the evening Sam Werner came, the Effringer Pfarrer, he had been with Plebst and with the Dr his brother, but heard not a word of your being there or he would have gone to see you. His mind is occupied with E.H. as the only person he knows and can pick up acquaintance with. So he enquired much and I had to answer as I could on several items, as bodily and mental health. Poor Feddy! I could not help thinking of the unnecessary pain he exposed himself to by the illtimed speculations and aspirations!

I liked Miss Betulius and Miss Schott, and hope the change pleases also dear Paul. May you be enabled to keep your soul in patience and have many a refreshment from above according to your wants for your own soul and for your patient!

Marie adds something for Paul. Give him my love Ich denke f√ºr ihn an Ps. 107. Er sandte sein Wort und machte sie gesund! Wenn nicht leiblich doch in der Seele, Gottlob. Das Heilmittel ist noch richtig da.

 With kisses
 Your HG
