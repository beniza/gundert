 Diaconis hause 13th J<an 71>*
Dear papa

I came all safe here, was glad from Calw to Weilerstadt to cover my feet with your shawl, Paul had no good night, I found him walking in the colidor* down. I think that he is thinner, and weaker. Now he wants me to write you to say that he does not wish to have his will done regarding going home, if you advise him to let the Dr search him now and judge whether he should, could go to Calw he will do it; but if you think best to ask nothink and remain quiet here he is contented with your wish will gladly follow it. so you are begged by Paul to say your mind, I find him worse, he has cough day and night a dry cough, our peopel think also that it is getting a cosomption;

I just hear that Caroline has died three ocl

About Paul the question is whether one could bring him afterward to Calw, he himself thinks not there is any danger, he told me just now I think I am on the way of getting better perhaps.

In Cornthal came Miss Magirus who had gone there to ascertain a place to burry Caroline who wished to know it as long as she still lived, from her I heard that Caroline has given her property to the Mission. Had I gone to Olga St before coming here I would still have found her. it is all right. Anna came yesterday. I have not yet seen her

Much love from Paul he wishe a quick unsewer

 with love to all
 yours J.G.
