My dear Children

By your last <v. 26. April>* I see that dear Christine has been less well. I trust that by this time she is better, trials, sicknesses, troubels, make us to pray and drow near to the Lord, therefore we must not dread too much that which is ment to help us toward heaven, The Lord has long patience with us till we put our trust fully in Him alone, and to create faith living faith in us He uses different means, without being urged to pray for delivrance and help we would pray but little. We know everything enough about religion and so on; but know the Lord studdy Him grow in His knowlege, thats a rare thing. and never the less this is the needful thing. St Paul knew Him, but wished to know Him better in His suffrings and death, he could so discribe Him as if a portrait had stood before the peopel. Oh for such knowlege of our blessed Lord by which we are renued and made like Him 
With best wishes for dear Christines health. Specially much love to the two dear daughters and with kisses to you all I remain Yours
 J.G.
