Sunday good morning Dearest Frederic

I hope that you get a good day with the Lord with His word which is the food and life of our souls; we want, but hunger and thirst after, than we shall be filled. These days I felt happy by the thought or words of our Lord "Care for nothing; because I care for you" Could we but believe how happy would we be under all circomstances The day of tomorrow shall care for itself so I have to think only for today, and if I have my Lord present with me what can be my cares, He cares for me, all His promises are for me, the text I had on new year too, that is open thy mouth wide I shall fill it. So that we can say with st John we have the petitions of our hearts. Yes dear son, cares for our daily work for all that which concerns us, the most minutes things He cares for us. We must believe and live with Him He shall fulfill His words

 Adieu my dear Son
 yours J.G.
