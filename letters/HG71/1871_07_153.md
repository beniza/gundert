Dear papa

It is all right about Mrs. Mög., Mrs Mörike can always find something for them, just now it is very full, the heat brings many peopel. Till now one based aonly every two hours; and the basins were not full; but now they are open every hour,

Much love to dear David I have no time to write him, as I take the next post to let Jettle know where are your badhosen. We are going to walk behind the church where there is a fine walk, and less peopel than in the allees, Half past 5 I go to the meeting and take on my way Miss Helfreich the aunt of Miss von Reutern

Adieu dear papa love to all from Uranie and self

 yours affectly J.G.
