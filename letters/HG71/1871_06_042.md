Dearest Frederic

I was glad to hear by your last that your health is some what better, can you get in the mission house wine when you want? try also some chocolade it has done you good formerly, Carl is by me during the time that his girl is in church, and he comes continually with something or other to rub on my paper. He is a good fellow, I bought yesterday 8 cherries for one creuzer he gets one after he has plaied a little; but he comes so often again for his cherry that they are finished, after every one he brings me the stone saying, "willst Du auch ein goodly" He is a fine dear boy, very thoughtful and considerate. He likes to hide the things so that one has to seek often, after he has plaid his little tricks he says "versteken" and laughs heartily, You will find him much improved. Theodor is also better since he goes to school.

It is very cold with us one might well have fire in the ovens, one must dress oneself like in Winter. Your shoes have not been sent, the paquet of Mr. Weitbrecht was already off; papa shall bring them to you, you will scarsly want them till then.

I trust your next will tell us that you continue to be well. Adieu dear son.
 Yours affectly J.G.
