Dear children

Many thanks for your last with the picture of dear Mary, she looks very nice and healthy, and Mama had put her on a fine dress.

I have not written you since the death of our dear Paul, by this time you know it already and will have thanked God for the delivra... of the body which since a very long time was a great burden to the spirit, He longed to be fry of the burden, to be with the Lord, and now he has his wish fulfilled, One would like to see and hear for a moment that which passes there In my mind I am still with him, I fancy to be very near him am as it were surounded by him, He will have been ashamed before the Lord for the want of faith, of childlike confidence, which he possessed in the begining of his conversion to a high degree; but the long trial shook it, We are poor and weakness it self if the trial or temptation indures long, To do the will of God in perseverence is a lesson difficult to learn, Oh for such simple faith which sees nothing but the Lord in all things, which learns after the Lord to say my food is to do the will of my father, I have still much to learn, so to look and wait upon the Lord in quietness of mind perfectly sure that He makes all right and with love as a tender father, 
I trust the Lord will let us injoye to His Glory the fruits of this trial. May also Pauls brothers and sister get some lessons which profit to Eternal life, that we may not be contented in thinking we are converted and have once believed, no but watch and pray that we may not fall into temptation, the Lord has not taught in vain to say, "Lead us not in tamptation, We can provoque the Lord to let us fall in to temptation, therefore it is written work out your salvation with fear and trembling. It is a sad thing if children have not the fear of the Lord! as natural creatures they are through the fear of God kept from sin already, and when faith comes they are the more happy and thankful without faulse security.

In writing you I have been leaving my pen continually to iron some black things which have been washed, pardon therefore my detached sentences, 
With kisses to the dear two daughters to their Mama and yourself I remain  yours affectly J Gundert
