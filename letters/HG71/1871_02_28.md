Dearest Jettle

I trust you are getting some rest in Stutgart and that your dear Aunt is not worse. Till now we have had so many visits that we had but little rest, yesterday I had Mina Laure to sew. On sunday Frederi Marie and myself went to the Lord supper papa kept at home having a cold.

I thank you dear Jettle for all the troubel you had during my absence, Frederic left this morning, We hear that Lotte Buhl is very ill in Diaconiss hause she was sent back from Tubingen with nervous fever.

If you see some of the dear people who helped my Paul give them please my love as well as to those who remember us; but special love to dear Mrs. Süßkind, May the Lord give you a happy time together

 Adieu dear Jettle
 Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
