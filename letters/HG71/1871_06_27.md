My dear wife

This is sent chiefly on account of the enclosure. We have had rather wet days, this afternoon looks a little brighter. Freddy has not too much to do, at least he spends now and then an hour with me as I try to help him somewhat on. Love to Marie chiefly from Mrs Wurm, Mrs Gretillat etc Emilie Ostertag I have not yet seen, but she is here. I return the letter of Mrs Rob.

We have visited Mr and Mrs Pfleid. the latter not much better, tho' she looks more cheerful. Georg Pl. is here, will accompany us on Saturday. I fear we shall not appear at Calw before 10' of the night, for if Uranie should be tired on Friday, we of course cannot travel in the night. I shall be guided by her first experience in the choice of 2d or 3d class. She has not yet written when she hopes to arrive here. Colin slept in Georg's bed for Uranie we shall get a place any where in the house.

I hope your soldiers are not troublesome, but rather glad of a quiet evening Love to all in the house, esp. to Thodo and Carle! If I bring them nothing else, then at least I hope an Otante.

 with several kisses
 Your Arger
