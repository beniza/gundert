Dearest Frederic

I am very sorry to hear that you have so very difficult to get any rest or quietness, it is hurtful for body and soul to be in a hurry or fidgitted, I know it by experience and can well feel for you. We will pray our good Lord together for a quiet mind fixed upon Him, He has said, "be careful for nothing. Let your wants be known unto God with prayers, supplications with thanksgiving then the peace of God shall feel your hearts and minds" 
I am glad that you read Steinhofer I like his works exceedingly, I read at present, his preachings on Colloser; but I feel one must be prepared for them, I would not have valued them so much formerly, I feel a greater want or need of the Holy spirit, to understand and realise this knowlege of the Lord of which he speaks so much, it is so deep that without the Holy spirit it passes like another book, Therefore May God give you and give me a greater measure of His spirit According to St Paul Ephesians 1..17,18,19 that's a prayer we have to repeat often with deep consideration 
 Adieu my dear son
 Y JG
