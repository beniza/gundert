Good morning dearest Frederic

Many thanks for so many letters which you kindly sent us, As the heat does not agree with your health you must take care not to expose your self to the sun, have your walks without the sun and if your room is exposed to it, shut up your venitians early, so that your room be cool at night. 
I trust that the Lord gives you to day sunday a good day, who seeks find, in Gods word is abundance of life; hunger makes us to see and the good Lord gives out of His fulness grace for grace. He has given His life that we may have it abundantly, not grudglu or sparly, but fully, Oh for more knowlege of that fulness of Him who likes to spred and communicate, Marie is in Stutgart, her two little ones are with me during the church they are nice. Theodor is improving really better than Carl who rules already over his brother

 Adieu deares Feddy yours JG
