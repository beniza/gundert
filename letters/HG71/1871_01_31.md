 <ca. 31 Jan 71>*

The paquet has just come with the letters many thanks Paul asks whether there are no letters for him please write him, he cares much for one of yours, Marie too, the 5 Thalers with the letters I have recieved thanks, So it seems the Lord has really heard the petitions and Paul is getting better he told to Aunt this morning You may well pray that I may soon be well. 
I thank the dear WÃ¶hrles for my dear old friends bonnet I accept it with thankfulness. from Caroline I get also things

This afternoon G'mama and Aunt are in Olgastreet,

I thank dear Marie for the shirts she has kindly sent for Paul, the flanel ones he shall not want but the others perhaps, thanks too for her kind letter, The Lord is very good to us, Sunday after P had been murmering against God, he said you see I wish to please God; but so I am you dispise me? I said I dispise you as I dispise myself and we had a good talk together, surely if the Lord restore him to health He will also give him an other spirit. We pray, and hope against hope we shall see the Glory of the Lord 
With love to all
 Yours J.G.
