 Wildbad 10th Jully 1871
Dear papa

I write again because I have still a petition in case Frederic or Marie should visit us, If there are still red treuble in the garden or groseilles Gousseberies I like to have some, for here one must pay them very dear, The effect of the bath is to constipate, Uranie who was never so is obliged to take bittersaltz I like fruits better, Uranie has a strong iruption on the face which was already red enough, but one says that it is good, We are both pretty well and like to bath,

This morning just as we had returned from the bath it became so dark that I said it is as dark as at 3 O'c the morning, there was then much thunders, lightnings, the woman of the house came in, to shut up the venisions, for we were in bad, she said that she had never seen such a weather, one of the lightings fell on the Telegram office, happily there was man at it. 
I wish also to have an other spectakels which are I thing in my big tabel in a red etui, if not there about, then the golden ones which are in the drowr of the big tabel on the right side a little far in the drowr I am sorry to give so much troubel, If no one was coming I need not to have any thing, and if they come I would also like to have my light goun which has been died it hungs in my Almira Jettle knows what I mean

<and 2 bottles wine for the guests Uranie drinks one bottle in a week.> 
If dear Marie wishes to spend a few days here, we have room on the saufa and shall be very comfortabel in every way. I do not wish to stop the bath in going home for a few days; but dear Marie shall be most welcome in our nice and very pleasant room.

Now with hearty love to each of you in the house and to Emelie  Yours J.G.

The Bibelstundy yesterday pleased me very much as well as the two prayers from the heart
