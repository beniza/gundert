 C. 10 Jul 71
My dear wife

Thanks for your letter received this morning So then I preached at Altstg, but in the afternoon Müller and Pf. Schmid left me no time so that I concluded only with a few words and with prayer. M is still here to see Widmann. I saw the latter on Saturday, as I had heard Louise Reinhardt had died the 7th. Yesterday was the burial at Münklingen, Widm was to pray at the grave. - The actress of course knows no better, I would rather seek to let her get a view of Jesus than to speak agst her way of earning her bread. - Would you not do well to set out a day with bathing instead of forcing the matter? I shall see about Pforzheim as well as I can 
Frohnm. was somewhat surprized by the Insp's official letter announcing his reception per "Du".

F Müller came here with young Staiger who did not please him overmuch. - Fred comes next Saturday

Love from several people, but most from
 your HG

Remember me to dear Uranie, I hope she does not overdo it.

David writes about his officers unwillingness to let him depart, must now exercise strongly and hear lessons from a lieutenant so that he doubts of getting leave. Any one may read it to you
