Dear Children

Many thanks for yours of <27 Sept und>* 1 Octo we were anxiously waiting to hear from you, though we had no idia that you were yourself in troubel or in anxiety about fire, it must have been a dreadful time and what a winter for so many who have no loging I am glad that the Lehmans did not come to you for they sit quietly were they are recieved I hope that the ointment salbe <(Kennedy's discovery)>* you got for your dear wife will do her good if not she will learn to trust to the Lord alone and wait upon Him 
You have been in great troubel about the fire; <(Erst am 31. Octob. kam Regen)>* but are now in rest; the misery is great no doubt not withstanding the help one is gathering on every quarter So your two daughters are again going to school and like it much I suppose; but the dear Mama has less help from them, and in winter she might perhaps want it most,

Uranie who writes now and then sends you love, she is pretty well so are we all inspite of the dread of the winter which makes me rather nervous, With love and kisses to each of you
 Yours J.G.
