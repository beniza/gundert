Dear Frederic

Papa will tell you where are the words I told Paul. I still live with him, see him and feel him very near, dear Paul thank God that he is redeemed from all evil, sees, injoyes that which he has here believed, he was his Lords property

Dearest Frederic I wish you perfect peace; but it may be difficult for you to have it as long as you are bound; those chains are like a burden which pull down gradually the life and happiness of the soul and body, there is an inward heat, uneasiness which injures body and soul. Oh dear son shake off those cares for the future, follow your Lord fully, He shall care well for you in due time if you live so long, and if not how many regrets would you not have to have had two Lords or two masters, I do not wish to grieve you dearest Frederic I only wish you to be truly happy a free servant of your Lord.

Tell us in your next letter how you are are the boils still so many, the blood of them on your shee... made me sorry for you, continue the fish oil 
 Adieu dear son Yours affectly JG.

1Ich glaube Mama sprach Paul zu mit 1 Cor. 16,13
