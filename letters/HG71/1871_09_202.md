Dear children

Many thanks for your last letter. We had no great heat like with you, only a few days it has been really warm and pleasant, now it is already so cold that one might have fire in the ovens, last night I could not get warm feet so that I must have already a bed flash. Yesterday the bread increased in price on account of the potatoes which are not good and few, The poor peopel who have learge family may find it difficult, however God cares for His children and the promise remains true those who fear God shall have no want.

The children of God have good for this world and next one, faith is only to be exercised and we become all good things,

To your dear partner and two daughters I send hearty love With a kiss to all
 Yours JGundert
