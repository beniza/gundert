My dear Frederic

You are getting rich in photographs, the likenesses of great many. The one of the Lord you are to keep in view not in a picture; but portrait before you as discribed by St Paul in Philli 2 ch 5-9 I find nothing so difficult as to fix my mind on the Lord and Paul says that we should know Him, studdy Him, that's the only way to become like Him, We want more of the Holy Spirit to reveal us our Lord and create in us a longing after His image reworked in us or reestablished in us.

I am glad to hear that you find your task easier, Adieu dear Son  Yours J.G.
