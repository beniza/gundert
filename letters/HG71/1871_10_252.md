Dearest Elisabeth

It seems to me a pretty long time since we heard from you, however I hear always indirectly about your health and work, I would not like to have so many visits as you seem to have continually, but having no school you can attend better to the other duties,

Do you know any thing about Sister Diez, is she ever writing to you, has she never acknowlege to have been wrong towards you?

10 days ago your brother with his bride were here for a few hours, they should have come sooner but Albert remaind esleep so that his bride had to wait in Zuffenhausen some hours where they had given rendezvous! She pleased us well, something natural, upright active about her, evidently well accustomed to work, Albert appeard to the same as ever.

I fear the poor wife shall get a hard life as poor dear mama had, however the Lord can change him. Our house is again lively since the boys have returned. With love to you both
 yours affectly J.G.
