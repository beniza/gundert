Dear Frederic

With us it is still so cold that one must have fire, I made none today so I can scarsly write from cold, All the news of our parts you get from Marie of course, and I could give you but little; for I know none however one thing should always be new and frish before us, the unspeakable love of our Lord, His life His suffrings, His death should be continually before us, that alone worms our cold hearts and inabel us to love and live for Him. To know Him creates in us trust, confidence and faith. We are too easily contented with the small mesure of knowlege which we have of Him, to know Him as Paul, John, Peter knew Him should be our ambition and greatest desire, we would then be more like Him, After this excellent knowlege I wish you an all of us much hunger and thirst

With love and a hearty kiss
 Yours J.G.
