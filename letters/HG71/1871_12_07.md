Dearest Frederic

Do not take amiss my advising you not to go to Corcelles for Christmas, because Uranie has but one warm room to go to the second to prepare you one to make it warm, would give her some troubel which she would do gladly I know, but with her weak leg I fear for her, also she has not her own housekeeping, but takes her dinnar with the persons who live in her house, if it was summer it would be more easy. though I am sure Uranie would do her best; but I think so, hower you can see what she writes, come to us it does not cost much more for the journey.

I was sorry to hear by your last that you were unwell and hope that you are now better We have a second Rikele whom we like very well She will make you good caffe after dinna, she is not so flink as the other; but very nice quiet working continually, The one of Nagold is happily married and likes her home Adieu my dear son trutz not with me I love you indeed With a kiss  Yours J.G.
