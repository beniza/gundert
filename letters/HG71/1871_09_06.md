Dear children

Many thunks for your welcome letters Specially Julia who wrote so long one We were quite pleased to see her hand writing, she may soon be her mamas secretaire I send her a tender kiss as well as to dear Marrle, I am glad to hear that they had joy in the few things which were sent them. And our dear Tinne whom we love heartily how glad would we be if her hand could be cured; but one cannot or should not do too much for it as it might injure her health. has she already drunk fish codliver oil? it might do her good, and how are her bowells? less constipated? We are happy to have a Saviour who is meawhile our physician too. only it is some time difficult for us to understand His treatement which must be accepted with faith and obedience; however we learn gradually to bow before Him to be silent and hear and when we understand, He knows to multiply peace and joy which after all becomes more valuabel than health, Adieu my dear children I have sent your few lines to Uranie who is in Corcelles and shall return Dieu V. next spring. with kisses
 Yours JG.
