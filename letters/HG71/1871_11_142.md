Dear Marie

We were glad yesterday to get again a letter from you, I write only to tell you not to be in a hurry to return for you might hurt yourself, and here you have so little rest with your children and other duties that you cannot recover your strength as where you have rest night and day which is necessary for you. We suppose you have something like the Gripp after the description of the pains which you have. I hope that you have no cough? One day Carl said my mama hat wehle man muss sagen heile heile sege drie Tage sone drie tage regen dan tuht mama neme weh, If one ask where your mama? in Stutgart sie hat Weh Wehle, They are thank God both well. With best wishes for your recovery and love to all
 yours affectly J.G.
