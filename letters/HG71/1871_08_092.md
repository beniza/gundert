My dear children

Many thanks for your last note <v. 14 July>* I am grieved to hear that dear Christine hand is not better, the spring is always the worse time; Surely the Lord will thereby bring her fully to Himself, so that she shall even thank thank God for the trial and say my father does all right, that is the very kind of illness wanted though I do not like it and another sort would have I chousen if God had given me the choice; That which makes us pray cry to God, is the thing which teach us to believe and rest patiently upon the Lord who also hears and helps in His own good time, I send my dear daughter a tender kiss with best wishes Julia and Marie will have found their little aprons which they like I trust.

I have been in Wildbad three weeks with Uranie, I do not feel as yet much better; but like Tinne I wait on my Lord, for my right hand which pains me, it is rhumatism I think, I can sew and knitt; but write is less easy. Uranie is pretty well; only the right leg is weak and pains her when she walks, she returns to Corcelles next week and intends DV to come next year to live with us.

Much love from her and from Yours
 J. Gundert
