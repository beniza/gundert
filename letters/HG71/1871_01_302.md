My dear wife

I hope you got my letter and Paul his, tho' you make no mention of it. I fancy the present of Paul may come from Bunz or Beringer (Praetorius), but I would not enquire, simply thank the Lord. I am glad David has got the smaller room with at least a less number of comrades.

Dear Paul, what shall I say, I prayed yesterday that this day may be the turning point either for release from this body of sin and death, or for a new supply of power and force to be poured into it. How can the Lord otherwise than pity his creature, his child in Jesus? Surely He is full of compassion at this moment. May we wait upon him with full confidence. 
Love fulfils the law, also His whole doing towards us is love and what He commands, He has done and does himself. He would give Himself a second time for Paul if it was needful. I greeted Kath. Schill in Hirsau and others in your name. May God give and multiply in us confidence in Him! 
I best send this to the Deaconess house as the shirts are wanted there. 
Best love to dear Paul. At the Seegers a girl lost her arm by the machine, it was afterwds amputated, but she died - seeing angels and very happy. In the evening we illuminated as the police wished all to join. No JÃ¼nglingsverein as Mezger Linkenheil has the smallpox. Goodbye. The Lord help quickly you, dear Paul and your
 H.G.
