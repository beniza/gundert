 [Oktober 1871]
Dear Jetthen <Isenberg>*

I thank you very much for having taken the troubel to write with such letters that I could read.

I was half afraid after dinnar that dear Marie was unwell as I did not find her at the post. I trust our Lord will soon restore her to health again; but she should at all event, not venture to leave Stutgart too soon as it might hurt her. The Children are cared for they live in our room, and the baby is really delightful, plays alone, sings most part of the day. On sunday it was so wet that we kept Theodor at home the whole day, once he said; but why can I not go on the street; however he was contented to play with Carl. Be not anxious about your little ones, nor about your lessons. May the Lord bless you and bring you back healthy in His time.

You were invited to take tea to day with Mrs. oberamtman. I have of cource sent word as well at your schoollers.

I trust dear Mama Isenberg is not too anxious and is kept from headach. 
With love to each of you and kisses
 Yours affectly
 J Gundert
