My dear Children

Papa has just said that today one sends to America, so mama will also send a salam to her children and grand daughters, who will probably begin again a corespondance with Grandpapa. It is pretty long I think that Julia has not sent a line, her picture is all good and nice; but her lines are missed. How many eggs have each of you got for ostern and what collor <colour>* had they?

I hope that dear Mama is better and has no more at least not so much constipation, one must take care for such thing; for the consequenceses are often hurtful.

I read with much delight some works of Steinhofer, the knowlege he had of our Lord is a rare thing in our days, it is really beautiful the manner his preachings are filled in showing the Lord, he portraits it before others, as Paul did to the churches, that is the way to touch the hearts and to edifie those who have already believed, to know the Lord Jesus to understand His mind is life, yes through His knowlege we live and become more like Him.

I wish you and me a great longing after this excellent knowlege of our Lord. May He by it make you a rich blessing to your congregation! 
I thank you for yours of March 15th just received after I had written this note

With love and kisses to each of you.
 Yours JG.
