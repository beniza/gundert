My dearest Frederic

Though I have nothing peculiar to say I will take the opportunity to send you my love,

You say nothing of your health do you still drink fish oil? and how do you find the work, is it not too much for your weak nerves? Try by all means to keep quiet in your mind, it is for you quite necessary to be calm and quiet, your work will be much more easy, things which are not necessary leave alone rather in order that you may have a time of rest with the Lord. We must know and experience what is that a life hidden with Christ in God. We must put all our cares upon Him He cares for us according to His promises, In your next tell us how is your health. I was very glad to hear from David: for, for him also one has to put all cares on the Lord, 
Next week we have the cleaning of the house

With a hearty kiss and love
 yours J.G.
