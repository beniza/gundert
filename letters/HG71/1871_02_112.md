 Saturday <11 Febr 71>*
Dear papa

Paul remains here, but he wishes much to see Marie and children; so she should bring them, perhaps monday if she can, I slept here as Paul was very miserabel yesterday evening, the night was better than I had expected, he is of course weaker, but can still live some time. he is happy in the Lord, and look for the home above contendes
 Adieu Yours JG
