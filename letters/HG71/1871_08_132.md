Dear Frederic

Please to inquire if Mrs. Faesch is at home as Uranie leaves this on the 17th next thursday she will go to her if she is in Bale, be so kind as to let us soon know please, she leaves vert Spalenweg 17

Uranie will of course be glad to see you at the gare if you can come if not Miss Buser can also care; but she would rather have you.

It is very sad about poor Julieus. God will follow him I hope and leave him no rest till he repent and return,

I hope your health is good troz the heat which we feel too hear. May the Lord keep you from useless thoughts and cares, wait upon Him and He shall care for you

 Yours affectly
 JGundert
