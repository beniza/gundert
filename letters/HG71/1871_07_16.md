 <Wildbad ca 16 Juli 71>*
Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind note, I thought you would have no time to come to this place, I trust the Lord gives you out of His fulness, so that you have a good day.

So my dear Frederic has <15 Juli>* come. I shall have the joy to see Him on the 25th when he shall I suppose accompany Papa to the Mission feast, then we shall D.V. return together to Calw. Uranie is nicely so we did not go to the Dr

I have comunicated your letter to Mrs Mörike who is very intimate with the dear Möglings, she hopes to find a convinient room in the school, nice logis are rare as of late more peopel came to this place. Mrs. Morike was astonished that one had not asked her directly. She seems to be very close with Mrs. M. So I am rather glad not to have the responsibility of choosing a room as one has little choice.

As I have an opportunity to send this I do it, shall write after ward about a logis if Mrs Mörike does not prefere do it herself. Much love and thanks to dear Marie with her dear sons A kiss to my dear son Frederic As I will go to Church I conclude

 With love yours afftly J.G.
