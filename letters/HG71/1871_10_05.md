Dear Marie

You have a fine day to return from Boll, The two boys will have much joy to see each other again, I have paid a visit to Mrs Helfer who is very happy her baby good and brave the Drs hope that after a few weeks his leg will be right. I think Elise is selling a good deal in your shop, I wanted black silk but there is none except very fine or very warm du you perhaps bring some? I pray you also to be so kind as to bring me 4 or 6 merredig papa who eats every day has but one remaining Give my love to all in the house I am very sorry for dear Georg that he has so much tooth ach. I trust Mr Robinson has got his lagage by this time give him my love. is he not a nice young man? Tante has surely no fear any more, If only he finds some one to push him on to learn, Can Georg and Emma do nothing towards it as teachers? 
are we to expect you for dinnar or for tea? Adieu love to all  yours affectly JG.
