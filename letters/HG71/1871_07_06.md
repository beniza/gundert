 Wildbad 6th July 1871
Dear papa

We came without rain, our two companions we very quiet, mounted the hill on foot, I was glad of it for Uranie who toke their place, which they took politely again, in coming in, We arrived at ten Oc, after dinnar I went to take 10 badcarte. It rained pretty much, specially towards evening, At 6 o'c we took the vashbad, slept pretty well, and this morning at 5 took our second bath, Uranie is delighted to see the beautiful arrangements, the water seems to work already with her, she has a good deal of pain and crampes, that which pleased me the best was the two hours in bed after the bath. If the weather was getting a little fine I would walk to shake off the heimweh; Uranie is as happy here as in Calw or Corcelles, she sleeps a great deal,

This morning I wrote the above, Since that I paid a visit to Miss von Helfreich who was just in her bed after the bath, she was glad to see me, she will visit us too,

Many thanks for the welcome note of dear Jettle just recieved 1 O'c, I shall DV write her afterward; but now my hand refuses if self, So dear David must remain in Ulm, I hope he will get permission to see us. I thank him heartly for his kind note, when my hand is better I shall write him a word.

The bath do not excite me I injoy the sun this afternoon, will sit in the garden during the time Uranie sleeps on the saufa, We are much pleased with our room with, the peopel, with the food and every things. If God gives His blessing that we may get better we shall be glad and thankful. One has rich opportunity here to find occasion to praise God in seing so many miserabels and poor creatures who suffer much more than ourselves.

With many kisses to Theodor and Carl, love to each of you and repeated thanks to have sent us here
 Yours affectly J Gundert

My love to all
