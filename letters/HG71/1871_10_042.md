My dear Children

Many thanks for your kind letter which came on the first Oct. I am also glad that Uranie has in mind to come to us, we shall see till the spring how things are, that your dear wife is also a selfworking woman is already given us true joy, the Lord has schosen for you the right person so that you are a happy husband and father, I have just the same feelings as her regarding others who are lady like and those who understand what is that working I trust Julia will forget the exemple of ladies like Miss Haas. Children are soon led away from good customs. the good wives as discribed in the proverbs are not so easily to be got in our days. May the Lord bless richly our dear Tinne, she must learn like me to make no self wrightousness of being a virtuous woman; but accept all as pure grace undeserved favour, As I have a sowing woman to make my winter gown which has been washed I must help to sew and say Good bye. with love
 Yours JG
