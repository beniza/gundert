 <Calw 9 Juni 71>*
Dear Frederic

I am very sorry to hear that you are so unwell But we have a Lord who is also phisician. He has already proved it with every one of us, May we learn to know what He wants from us, what is there to be given up and what is to be taken instead.

In His love He prepares us for His kingdom through many trials, they are ment to help us to know ourselves and know our Lord, to know His unspeakabel and everlasting love. Oh dear Fredric had we more knowlege of His love toward us, the world and things of this world would have no attraction for us, Live to our Lord would be our chief desire, The time is short we have to confess Him, prepare ourselves for His coming. We have it so good with Him,

Carl is indeed a shelm see how he rubbed on this note, now Adieu dear Son  Yours J.G.
