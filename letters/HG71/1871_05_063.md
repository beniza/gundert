My dearest Frederic

I am giving you pretty much troubel and expenses with my notes to Corcelles and Rolle. I shall once repai you no? <Ich glaube Du darfst das als für mich aus dem Miss.portokäßchen bestreiten.>1

I was glad to hear that your health is better and that the summer arangements shall suit you better. In your last you say nothing of Steigers health, here one knows nothing of it, his sister has an opportunity to mary a schoolmeister. whether she will have him one does not know, she is somewhat high minded, for How long shall you have leave to remain here after the feast? Uranie who intends to come, might perhaps return with you if you remain 4 or 5 weeks!

I must say Adieu having to write to her too

 With love
 yours J.G.
