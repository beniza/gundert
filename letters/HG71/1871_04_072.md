My dearest Frederic

As papa says that one writes to you today, I will send you a good morning and good wishes for these days, that they really be a great blessing for your soul, That the Lord reveal Himself more and more to us, through His word and through His holy spirit, to know Him to become more like Him should be our earnest and greatest longing and prayer, The world and self become less important and much smaller if the Lord Jesus stands in His Magesty, in His greatness and glory before us, If we can see Him as He was in His humiliation and suffring in perfect obedience for us, it warms our cold hearts and makes us to pray.

My dearest Frederic my prayer for you is that you may be made free from all ties which may hinder you to look freely to the Lord and trust Him fully. for body soul and spirit it is a precious thing, to be bound to Him alone. With best wishes for rich blessings and a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
