 Stuttgart Diaconisshause <16 Febr 71>*
Dear papa

Thursday <16 Febr>* first of all Paul begs <Vtr schrieb schon am 15>* that dear papa would kindly write to Professor Oehler in P. name to thank him heartily for his viele liebe und treue as well as his whole family, he thinks very often about them they are very dear to him, and he would be very thankful for a few lines from him, and ja if he was coming to Stutgart be so kind and visit him.

the night was not so good as the former one however he is as usual, has drunk some Teinach walter with pleasure. We have just recieved your second letters with the inclosed of Frederic and Jettle, Marie will have come home safe and happy,

Do not troubel yourself so much about Paul and do not come again so soon, one can do nothing, How do you sleep?

Paul is nice, now and then speaks how it will be in Heaven, the last place shall be accepted with thanks, God the whole God, father, son, and Holy spirit are his God and he feels happy in Him. He wishes also to be less occupied with eating and drinking.

Plebst has gone yesterday to Kirchheim and elsewhere, his foot is not well; therefore he is nervous and somewhat cross, the journey will do him good. 
Paul sends hearty thanks for your letters,

Knorr visited him yesterday, David was here too; but not by Tante the evening. Dr Sick comes every day twice, The sisters do what they can to help Paul, at night one person for himself alone which is much as the house is ful and one wants many peopel to watch

Now I will put these lines to post wishing you peace and quietness of mind as I wish it for myself, with the Lord alone it is to be found, and He give gives it fully if the mind is set upon Him alone, We have often experienced how good and gracious He is, how sweet it is to rest fully on Him that we will by His grace do, see Him alone and wait upon Him, thanking that He has made Pauls mind soft, he prays often, askes God pardon for his many sins; for such grace of God in him we should thank much,

 Adieu dear papa Love to all,
 Yours J.G.
