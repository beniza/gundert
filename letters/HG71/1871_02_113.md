 <Samstg 11 Febr 71>*
Dear papa

At eleven Ocl Paul settled that he would remain here so I wrote quickly a few lines took them to the post, <kam erst Sonntg Morgens>* afterward as I went to dinnar Georg sent off a Telegram, so that dear Jettle had not yet empty her room I trust, As long as it is so cold Marie should not come with her children it is too cold, Paul may still live longer than we think, perhaps even some weeks, the Dr sais it is good that the matters go in the bowels and not remain in his stomach, he has a little diarrhee, and on the whole not worse than when you saw him, he has decided to remain here first because the train goes too early, secondly he has not his Dr in Calw, and when he goes in vally of death fater and mother cannot help him he must have his Lord, he is nice prepares himself for the departure, pray that God would make it ertr√§glich and give him a soft end, As Mr Knorr take this I make haste

Be not in a hurry to come dear papa, the Lord is gracious to us. Yesterday he spoke much of daying, he had bang and fear and said I feel death near, however the night was pretty good! and to day is pretty good, 
Mrs. Director as usual I found her on her saufa

With love to all. If no one comes on Monday send me please the poket handkerchief

 Adieu Yours J.G.
