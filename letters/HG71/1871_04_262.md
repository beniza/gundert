Dearest Frederic

As papa send to day letters to Bale I send you a few lines too. In one of your letters you said that you feel sickly, how is it now? Is perhaps the liver again in disorder or your stomach?

Mr. Frohnmayer will take your duty at the mission feast and help the Gentlemen with Bier.

The young Mrs WÃ¶hrle ge Buhser is going to Bale next week she will return after some weeks with her younger sister Louise.

Do you find the food right? have you no diarrhee more? Your papa is not yet quite well, the old cold troubels him still, We are becoming old, and shall be glad to come to the rest promised to the children of God. 
Let us walk strait towards our heavenly home, Paul has gone before, he draws us after him, Adieu dear Son
 Yours J.G.
