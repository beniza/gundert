 Calw 3d March 1871
Dearest Jettle

Many thanks for your few lines and for all the news you give us, Tomorrow shall be here the great day of illumination, the children are to get presents,

So dear friend you spend your birthday in Stutgart, well surely it will be very agreabel for you to be amongst your friends and relations. I wish you many rich blessings, and a pleasant time,

I have just seen Mrs. Lechler the Decan had a burial, they will drink tea with us on monday I am sorry that you are not present, but as it is perhaps the only free day they have we have taken it, of course I shall be obliged to care for all, Lydia is some what better, they are very busy with sewing and paking, Marie Bußer has been with me two hours, we drunk caffee, Marie is the English cercle, by Miss Herman, Rikele is in the garden working, The new Precepteur with his lady have paid us a visit they seam to be nice peopel,

Emelie S told us that we may perhaps get here as Decan Helfer Kämler that would be really too good I do wish it heartily, Calw would hear the Gospel, as they have seldom heard it, by them we would get many good friends. 
We had many visits, just as we were ironing came Mrs Herman and afterward Mrs. Marie Stelin. Please tell my dear peopel in Stutgart that I am still with them in thoughts Their love and cares for Paul and myself is not to be forgotton and I pray the Lord to reward them richly, give them my sincere and hearty love, how is Georgs foot? is Tantes Catarrh better, and Mama has she no fever? Much love to Dear Mrs Director and to all who remember us 
 Adieu dearest Jettle
 Yours affectly
