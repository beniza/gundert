My dear Jettle

Many thanks for your kind note I feel quite at rest here as you are at home with all the troubel I am very sorry that you must have the wash alone; Let Rickele buy 4 four pound of smierseif and two pounds of good soap to boil the clothes, pieces to wash you will find in the top of the Almira in the corner of my bed room. each woman becomes a bottle of white wine a loaf of two pounds, half a quarter pound of cheese for fesper; but I think Rikele knows already, and Mrs sheffel can tell you all, only please do not give yourself so much troubel the three women can well finish, even help to hang it up. each get 30 Cr for one day.

I have just seen Mrs. Süßkind who is better she can walk in her room and shall be glad to see you for some days when you can; of course after the departure of P.

My love to all those who think of us,
 Yours affectly J.G.

I am sorry that you have sent me your own poket hankerchives I return them with many thanks, I let wash here, and get them pretty quickly, 
Je remercie de coeur chŠre Emelie pour son bon petit billet, comme aussi pour la gel‚e qu'elle a eu la bont‚ d'envoyer … P. pour le moment il a suffisament tant avec celle qu'elle lui a envoy‚ et de la mˆme que Mme Steinkopf lui a envoye aussi, si plus tard il en avait encore besoin je prendrai la liberty de le dire, Mes amities et remerciements … Mme Seeger et Mlle Shill. Oui le Seigneur est bon au millieu de l'‚preuve et il benira ce temps pour nos ames je le crois, il me faut attendre jour par jour comme un enfant,

After the wash send me please poket hankerchieves and a shirt for me and the night shirts of Paul if David s box has not come must send to the führman the key to open it is with other keys hanging on the side of the bookshelf on the green tabel where papas cap stands
