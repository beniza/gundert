Dearest Frederic

I would have sent you a few lines per post to wish you a blessing on your birthday; but as Miss Busser is going to Bale to morrow I wait for the opportunity to send you a piece of cake and a portfeuil from dear Paul, 
Please tell us how is your health are the boils diminishing? Since you left Papa has not been well, he had an inflamation of the throat with much fever, could not eat nor speak without pain. He is thank God somewhat better; but not well as yet,

Marie tells you I suppose how beautiful was the illumination, papa and myself did not go out of the house to see,

yesterday evening the Decans were here for supper, Jettle is still in Stutgart; shall return Thursday. David writes seldom he may have to go to Ulm. 
It seems to me that you have not written since pretty long Adieu dear son May the Lord bless you and make you really happy in Him, If the pardon of our sins and the love of Jesus is present and dear to us, than we can be happy, but these things must be fresh and great before us, then all others appear small and of little value compared to this,

 Now Adieu my dearest Frederic
 yours affectly J.G.

Did you sent my letter to Uranie?
