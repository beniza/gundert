Dearest Frederic

I am again troubling you with letters for Corcelles;

We were glad to hear that your health is so good. It will be a good thing for you if David should come to Bale, at least you might have the sunday together, in your warm room. There is in Calw and in the villages a good deal of sickness

Mr. Buhl and Mrs Schram have not heard from Africa since a long time they think that letters have been lost with a ship. Buhls bride is a fine person she has made a good impression on us all, we shall see more of her afterward, of Marie being unwell in Stutgart you will have heard, she shall return D V after a few days, her boys are well, and we all tolerably 
Adieu dear son
 Yours JG.
