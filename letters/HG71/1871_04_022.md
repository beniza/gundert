Dear Frederic

Papas letter to you is just standing before me so that I can still put in this bit. Steiger told us that you are looking pretty well. I hope that it is so, however our peins and unwell be must bring us nearer to our dear Lord, to know Him, to grow in His knowlege should be our greatest wish and indevour, like Paul who wished to know Him in His suffrings and death. I am reading preachings of Steinhoffer who lived more than 100 years ago, they are most beautiful in showing the Lord, I have long wished and prayed that I may know more my Lord these preachings are given to me as an answer to my prayers, I wish you could read them too, look in Bale after them, but the heart and the spirit has its time.

Adieu my dear son
 Yours JG.

I am better but not yet quite well
