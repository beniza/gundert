My dear Jettle

Many thanks for tow kind notes of yours, you are indeed too good, even to think of sending kake, only think that I have recieved no less than four boxes with goodle and I do not eat one Friday from dear Rosine Kappler Goodly with appels which were indeed well come and a very kind note so written that I could read it and understand fully Please give her and hers my sincere love and hearty thanks, I shall return the box when I come. Yesterday evening I got three boxes at once, two from Calw as you know, I shall thank when I come peopel are really much too good to me; The third bix was from Stutgart with kind notes from G'mama and Tante Emma, they send plenty Lebkuchen and figues, I am really ashamed and grieved, If you write or Marie to Stutgart please tell those two dear ladies, that I thank heartily for their kind notes and good wishes; but all the good things are too much, I am sorry that they knew I am here! I would rather get no present! 
The kake has just been brought for which many thanks, it is very good; but send me nothing else I pray. niether from you nor from any one. 
Please give my love and thanks to dear Emelie to Mrs Scheffel to her whole house hold
