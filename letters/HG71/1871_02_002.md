Dear Jettle

Much love to dear Marie and all, how is her fingre and those of dear Carls. Your Aunt I have see twice she is nicely has invited me to drink caffee with her as it is too far to Grandmama I shall go some time, I feel no want of caffee by Paul, he likes if one sits by him, so I must not write too long.

Martha Steiger I saw just before she had to leave for Heilbroon where she shall remain only two month, she appears to me just like before, she tried to weep as I told her of her family and of their grief because she speaks still lies now, she then said I will no more do it, I could not speak long with her, as a man wanted to take her away she said the things which she had bought for her peopel of which they had to pay the account are still in her box, she does not take all her things in Heilbroon,

Pardon that I write so little, and so d‚tach‚e but every line I must leave my pen to do or hear some thing, the Miss who nurses him has much to do and P does not like her, love to all specially to Emelie

 Adieu yours J.G.
