1Dearest Frederic

I am glad that you like the Busser, I think your judgement about food and work in the mission house is not right, there are many dear children of God who would be very thankful for such food and work in preparing themselves for the work of the Lord, where the love of Jesus, the love and desire to save souls, to confess our dear Lord existes surely such would be thankful for the privilege to learn and prepare themselves for that glorieus and blessed work. You do not see with right eyes, The world and flesh can not see according to the spirit, Oh we want a greater measure of the Holy Ghost to renew us, Dear son if we are born again we are to walk in newness of life, May the Lord give you give me more of His holy spirit so that we know what is that to be dead and burried with Christ; but also know and feel the power of His resurection, Adieu dear Son

Again a letter to Uranie please, excuse
