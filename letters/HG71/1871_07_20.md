 <Wildbad>* 20th July 1871
Dear papa

I am glad to see the time <(5-25 Juli in Wildbad)>* drowing to an end, for such an idel life could not satisfy me too long, I feel thank God very nicely, sleep well, eat much, If only you could injoy such a time of rest, you want it more than me, poor dear papa if only one could help you, 
Your letter has just come many thanks for it, We are quite decided to leave Tuesday Uranie does not think it would be good to bathe longer, Our room is already taken by the minister for a lady who is in his house who must make room for others who had the promised to be taken long alo, Every moment one sees people walking about seeking rooms. It is good that Mrs. Mögling does not come now.

I keep Möglings letter to show it to Mrs Mörike

With love to all
 Yours JGundert

Dearest Marie

Please see whether I can send this note in Deutch to Grand Mama if not be so kind to write her my mind,

Only think that Uranie sings a great part of the day and longs to sit in your room to hear you and Frederic She has asked whether papa does not play and sing she wishes to hear, she calls the two little boys in our room to make them to sing and she helps them on. She feels herself much better, that is her leg not yet; but the digestion, she has good appetite and is very happy, she has indeed a beautiful temper, much better than mine, 
Much love to dear Freddy to your pets If the dear peopel who come, dine with us send me please through them one bottel of wine.
