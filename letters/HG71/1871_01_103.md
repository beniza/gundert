My dear Frederic

Already 12 days since you went away. You have had much to do; but are well I trust.

About Paul you will have heard that he is less well, fever and bad nights, I hope to see him soon, and if the Do allows him soon to come, he shall come when the weather allows it; poor dear Paul he is in a hard school, we have to learn too, may God give grace that it profits us all. Poor Mrs Steiger was yesterday very ill one feared that she is getting nervous fever; but today she is thank God better; if her son does not know it do not tell it, as one hopes it will soon be over. They have a sad trial in Martha, our sorrows are nothing compared to theirs; but the Lord helps and give them blessings therby, the mother is very nice.

Forget not please when you see the dear Bu√üer to thank for the useful cooking machine which they have sent me through you.

Cal Isenberg is growing very fat, he is very brave and nice, he is often in our room, Grosspapa is of course the drowing magnate for him. 
Give my love to all those who remember us specially Mrs Hager 
Adieu my dearest Frederic
 Yours Julie Gundert
