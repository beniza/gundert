My dear Children!

I have to thank you for your kind note of the 8th relating your feelings of the first Oct. We thank God together that He has had merci on us, and given us life in His dear son, having created a living faith in our hearts, faith is some thing from God it understands God it goes in God, for faith all is possibel it overcometh all, faith can renew us making us some what like our Lord, through faith He lives in us reestablishing His image in us, many thoughts and much work does not help much toward it, but become like a child, to hear is so difficult. Keep silence before God in order to hear and follow is a precious gift for which I pray often. To love the word of God, to apreciate it, to value it, feel and realise that it is the bread of life sweeter than honny, is also my fervent wish.

All the news about us you know, since three days papa is away in Tubingen and Stutgart, we heard indirectly that our dear Paul is less well, I feel of course somewat anxious to hear from papa. May our Lord give us soon the fruits of this affliction which is not light for us. It is the Lord, may we not oblige Him to bring us into temptation.

 Much love and kisses to you four
 yours J. Gundert
