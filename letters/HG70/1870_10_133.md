My dear Paul

I felt very sorry after I had left you. and was glad to hear that David was immediatly going to see you, Oh my dear son the whole day I am with you in thoughts,

I have as duty paid a visit to Mr Doc Muller and Sch√ºtz who are taking much interest to your case. they send you love specially Muller. he said that you should let the Dr look in your ear, Now you are in good hands and with Gods help it will soon be better I trust; I am desirous to hear how you have slept, has the man still schnarch? I hope and pray that you may soon have a room alone, how are the pains. I must say Adieu because the post is going

With a tender kiss and love from Jettle
 Yours J G
