 Calw 9th Jan 1870
Dearest Marie

We were very sorry to hear by your note of yesterday that Dear Ch was less well, so that when we begin to hope for recovery a warning comes telling us to wait on the Lord look to Him alone expect all from Him alone, be ready at any time!

We were ful of joy thinkhng of the future recovery; but so we have to learn to rejoice alone that our names are in the book of life, this remains uncheangebel.

I was glad to see that Mrs Shirt is going on well with Margaret 
I have put on once the beautiful Chall which you gave me; the dress I shall have made soon, then I shall be very elegant.

Are not the lettres of Herman very nice?

Please tell dear Jetthen with my love that I trust she will come to Calw for some days we wish her to pay us a visit if possibel with Mrs MÃ¶erke who is coming on the 16th or 17th of this month. but if Jetthen preferes an other time she is at perfet liberty, we shall be happy to see her at any time. What news from Peregrina?

Love to Mama Isenberg to the two boys and specially to dear papa With kisses
 yours J. G.
