Dearest Marie

2 thank you heartily for the shirts you have kindly sent, last night Paul had the three flanell ones. I fancy to see your dear Charles in them, Paul like them they are broader than the ones of Frederic which he would not put on,

I am sorry to hear your dear little one has still to suffer in the nose and even in one eye dear Carle, kiss both for me, I think much of you these days how you had one year before to prepare for the departure of your dear partner. May the Lord who has helped hitherto keep and bless you with the little ones. Give my special love to dear Marie Busser and her sister Mrs WÃ¶hrle

 Adieu dearest Marie
 Yours J. G.
