 <Calw 25 April 1870.>*
1My dear Paul

I thank you heartily for your kind letter which has refreshed my heart and given me new courage to learn to wait upon the Lord, trust Him fully in all things, Now I have to trust Him for my journey to Corcelles, where I go to morrow D. V. I wish you to pray for me and Uranie that we may have grace to speak to poor Fritz Fillinger who has just come from America. Uranie in every letter sends you hearty love and even a book; but I did not give it you, she loves you dearly. You know that poor Fillinger is 2a bad man, not only drink much but lead even a bad life. pray for him

3Adieu mein liebster Paule. Es küßt Dich Dein Friedr.
