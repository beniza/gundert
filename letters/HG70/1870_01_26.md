Dearest Elisabeth

This time I am in great hurry writing you a few lines, we have wash and I should be in the celler putting bier in bottels, besides visites just as one has much to do, hower it was a nice man who just came, the blind Joseph who helps Miss von Seckendorf.

I was much rejoiced to hear that your health is so much better since your visit in Telli. By this time our dear Frederic is perhaps on his way home or to Mangalore, putting his things right, if he can that is, his last letter makes me more anxious as he has more pains, that it the pain is stronger than it was, We long to see him in our midst and trust the Lord will bring him safe to us, I thank you heartily for all your love and cares of him.

Dear Jetthen has spent a few days with us I like her well, a fathers blessing rests on the children. One feels it, she speaks little; but her silence and uprightness make very dear.

Now Adieu my dear children with kiss
 Yours J G

love to the dear Diezes
