Dearest Marie,

Please give my thanks to dear Jettle for her kind letter, so we expect her here Saturday. I am glad to hear that dear Charles likes the Zwiebach, may he injoye these.

Theodor is nice, slept the whole night, plays now with Ch. Sheffel. I walked with them these two days; he complained of the cold, however it does him good he learns to walk as a man, he had joy to pay visit to his Godmother on our walk; but she was not at home, however he got goodle from Mrs Lamparder that suficed him of course. I wish our dear Charles peace and joy in the Lord waiting upon Him who shall soon come

with love to Mama I Jetthen and kisses to you three
 Yours J G.
