Dear Emma

I thank you for being strickt with my Paul, he has sent us* word by David that he is very "dichtig" hungry and thursty. we are to send him something soft to eat "nicht hart und nicht troken". Die b√∂se Yemma give him no wine and bier without the Doctor's permission, Do Dear continue I beg you to keep ferme to the Diete

I send herewith some marmelade for him to eat with veken if the Doctor has no objection against it According to the last lines of David Paul is better, sleeps more too, so that one must take care not to spoil with eating and drinking that which is now gained, Please dear do with him as if he was your own for his good, only give nicht nach, be ferme, he loves you respects you and the Docteur, so you may do better than any one, 
Please send me back the box with his flanells which want to be washed 
Adieu pardon haste from
