My dear Emma

I have the pleasure to send four your house haltung with dear Tante a Goass As I have it from neighbours I know that it is young; but whether it is good I do not know

I was glad to hear that dear Georg is again pretty well. I thank you both with dear Mama and Tante heartily for all your love, cares for our dear Paul as well as for all the troubel you have with us.

Be so kind and send me my old box in which were the Zwiebach that I may send you some more,

Please ask Caroline <WeiÃŸ>* whether she has not recieved 10 days ago a small box with Zwiebach and a few lines from me Adolph told my husband that Caroline expects a letter from me; if she has got the box she must have had the few lines too. and if she wants more Zwiebach she must return my box and send me one of her own for the Zwiebach. Is not dear Mama somewhat tired in her new office. We are glad for dear Samuel that he is with you. 
How is dear tantes foot? With love to All first, third, fourth, logis and to Olgastreet, special love to your dear partner and self
