Dear Frederic

I thank you for sending my letters so often to Tante Uranie, I shall return you the many Centimes which you are using for my letters. If you come on Christmas it will be a good occasion to pay my debt to you.

I am glad to hear that your health is so good, that your room is down stair so that you have not to ascend

All the news you get from papa and Marie so I need not say farther. Have you seen the Busser?

Gootthold Steiger will feel uneasy about his fathers ilness, his mother is very nice and takes quietly from the Lord that which He is pleased to send, Love to all who ask after us, also to Alsenberg Muller.

 With a kiss
 Yours J. G.
