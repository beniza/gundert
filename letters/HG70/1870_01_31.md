My dear Children

I have to thank heartily for a long letter you have kindly sent me, before I can tell you any thing about our familys birth and death I must ask Uranie to write me these things. she know them indeed better than me. 
So Julie writes you letters, well she begins early, she will be her mama secretaire and papa too now and then, Having Theodor here I think more of your two dear pets than I would other wise poor dear boy is difficult to educate and shall have hard all his life, for he is very selfwilled and fantastic, he gets up usually ill humourd, besides these bad qualities he has good ones, to day as he got very cross Jettle said the bad spirit is troubling you again shall I not help you to drive him away? Ja she gave him one or two slaps he took them in good spirit and became amiabel, he can be very agreabel and lovely when he will, that is, if the bad spirit has not the upermost over him.

My good Christine in hearing this report of Theodor will feel proud that her little ones are better; but no she will be thankful to God and know it is not her doing but Gods grace alone

With a hearty kiss to each of you
 yours affectionate J. G.
