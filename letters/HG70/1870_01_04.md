Dear Marie

Many thanks for your letter just recieved, we are glad to hear that dear Ch continues to be pretty well and that the stokings were welcome though coarse.

When I was in Stutgart I gave nothing to the two servant girls expecting I would come again soon, I said so to them, so now please give them from me this gulden with my salam.

Papa and Julie shall bring us news from you all, Paul was nice <3 Jan 70>* when he left, more is still desired and God who has begin to open his eyes will I hope do his work farther in him. With true love and kisses to you all
 Yours J. G.
