My dear Elisabeth

It seems to me a long time since I wrote you, As long as our dear Paul was here I found very little time to sit for a few minutes, except in his room where most time the shutters were shut up. All what has passed you know well, and can imagine that I have often heimweh after him, specially when I hear that he is less well; and what I can do nothing but pray, and learn to submit and believe

I had much joy to see again your dear Mother and sisters, the first was then well and happy I found her more chearful than in usual. Jetthen was not quite well, but it was a passing complaint, Peregrina after salutation and drunk coffe together went out to buy things and I saw her no more as I wanted to go quickly to the Diaconissehouse. I shall probably go some time to Stutgart during the winter to see Paul. Georg Plebst was with us for a few days, we had much joy to see him here. Dear Emma as well as G. visit dear Paul very often which is a comfort to us, David who is again in Stutgart will do it too

You are now getting the cool season I trust it will do you good 
Do you ever hear from Emely Stolz MÃ¼ller? How are the Diezes? give her please my love and to all those who remember us black and white 
With love and kisses to you both
 yours J Gundert
