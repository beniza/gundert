My dear Frederic

I thank you heartily for your two welcome letters, We were glad to hear, though grieved to see that you do not feel quite well, please tell us what is the matter with you? In winter it may be difficult to get a room for you alone on account of the wood one has to spare, to have to warm two rooms instead of one is to be considered specially as the donations for the mission are scarce on account of the war. I trust the Lord will help you to put up with the difficulties you have to meet, thinking you do it for the mission and after all have still better than many others. Papa went thursday to Stutgart Friday in Tubingen again in Stutg where he is to spend the sunday. We have not yet heard, though I feel anxious having heard from Jetthen I. to Marie that Paul was less well. David went away Wednesday; but we have not heard from him, Perhaps papa writes you direct from Stutgart, Peopel here did put up their flags hearing of Metz; but our remaind fold up had you been here it would surely have been put up too. we let it quiete till Paris be gained I hope the Lord is near you keeping and blessing you. Do you find your work hard or difficult? As Marie gives you all the news about us I need not say anything Jetle sends you love, Emelie has been asking for news about; but I did not show your letters only related what you wrote. My love to Mrs Hager and to all

 Adieu yours affec
 J G.
