 [Januar 1870]
Dear Marie

Only a few lines, with thanks for the news and photograph you sent, We are sorry to hear that dear Charles is not better, so troubeld with cough and the little one not quiet at night, he is probably teething.

All the news about Theodor you get of course from papa. I only want the grey flanell dress which he had here formerly it is old but however he might put it on on his sunday trawsers, his daily or common trawser are so torn that one cannot mend them, so I thought he might put on the sunday one with the flanell ones which you have in St. I mean the one you brough from India gray.

Papa has a catarrh and at night troubeld with some fever. but he is up and makes as if all was well

Now Adieu dear Children with love to all
 yours J. G.

I am going to see Mr. Baetzner who is ill.
