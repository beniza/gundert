 Stutgart Saturday <5 Nov 70>1
Dear papa

Emma has already written to you how it is with dear Paul. I found her in bahnhof were she told me that Paul had had a good night. I found him happy looking nicely and stronger but it is the effect of the wine which he takes gladly; on account of the great weakness, and it is almost the only thing he can bear however he kept a plate full of sago soope at dinar time. As he cannot take his injection alone I gave him one, I had scarsly given him half a shopen that he felt much pain et could take nomore, since that he has the crampes again he has no stool the injections even remain in the body, he has troubel and pain to let water go out and it is dark red. 
I shall remain here at all event till dear Emma returns from Laufen where she goes next week for a few days.

As I have the good opportunity of sister Louise Zahn I send you this few lines by her, I am writing by the side of Paul who sends much love. The Minister <Mast>* comes three times a day to see him, the Dr whom he asked what he thought of his state ansewred that the evil is deep and complicated, one cannot say any thing as yet. Now that he has pain he looks miserabel and takes nothing at all, from fear to increase the pain. In the midle of the woond is a small whole coresponding to the nose ear and throught. When he keeps his breath pinching his nose the matters flow out of that little whole.

 More tomorow I trust
 With love yours J. G.
