Dear Children

It is already long since I have sent you a single line, I have spent three weeks in Corcelles during which a few days in Rolle too. As Marie Monnard lives there, she as well as many other peopel did ask much after you and send you hearty love, Uranie specially. I found her some what weaker than formerly; but on the whole pretty well; poor Fritz Fillinger is I fear riunirt and past hope as regaring repentance and faith to god, how ever all is possibel to God, but he is gone far in sin and destruction, Marie Monnard with Miss Jorand related of your visit in Vevey <1859>* and how you brought them to Corcelles hoping that Papa would remain a day longer to see them; but it was in vain Marie <Monnard>* is poorly, suffers from bad dijection, Henriette Jorand has been very near death, is still very weak and ill; but of a chearful and happy disposition, thankful to God for all His doings towards her; while this is not the case with Marie.

That our dear Paul is deaf of the right ear is sad; and I feel very sorry for it; but I must be silent before the Lord and believe all is for the best.

With much love to your dear half to the two pets I remain
 Yours affectly
 J. G.
