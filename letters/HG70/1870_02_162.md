My dear Children

These days we have been expecting letters from you; but in vain, we shall have next week I trust, hoping that you are well and nothing serious has prevented your writing to us.

So now we see that dear Frederic shall not be here before the end of March which is perhaps good on account of the cold, this month here is very cold more so than January was. I hope that you are all spared from illness this winter, as ourselves hiether too thank God, papa had Catarrh but is again nicely. Paul writes that he is as if he had a new body so well as he has not been since some years, but his mind appears to be the same I do not understand him, he writes us very short letters just what is absolutely necesary, it grieves me, I fear often there is spiritual pride without his knowing it! Papa sees David often on his repeated visites to our sick Charles; he writes little however he is more affectionate then Paul at least in words. the few days he spent with us in Christmas were nice. Jettle was obliged to go to Stutgart on account of her aunt who was ill, during that time I had the bubele Theodor who behaved musterhaft indeed nice and aimiabel, even some what obedient which is much for him, he is exceedingly clever full of understanding; but idel and terribly eigensinnig. I trust you give us soon good news of your two dear pets and of dear Mama, we were amused to hear that you follow her or give her way only in things which you hear from papa, but in truth I suppose you go beyond that, she is so a clever house mama that you must give her way, in many things I send her a tender kiss as well as to your two dear daughters, with true love  Yours affectly
 J. G.
