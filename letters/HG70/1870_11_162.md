Dear Frederic

Having written a long letter to Uranie my hand is tired,

You will please write to Uranie in sending mine telling her how she is to send you for us the interets which she is to get from America, till now we got them direct, but this time my brother send them to Uranie through Geneva. So be so kind to write clearly, shortly how she is to do in order that you get it for us

From papa you will hear how Paul is, as he goes to Stutgart, How is your health, can you sleep pretty well? So you have the supper late, you will get accustomed to it in thinking that there is every where something unpleasant, and with faith and a good will to overcome one self God makes that nothing hurt us, Hebich used to say when I did not like to go to Cannanore from Cherical on Sunday on account of the rain "if you had faith it would not rain" May the Lord give you peace in Himself, with love  Yours J G
