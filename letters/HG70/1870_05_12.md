Dear papa

Many thanks for your welcome of the 8th thanks also to Freiderle, Mary, Jettle. I was very glad and thankful to get them.

I would have written yesterday; but was too unwell, I got a severe cold in going to Rolle or there, I think I never had a cold so severe and tenacious, fever, rhumatism all over, one eye red and paining, I feel to day better so I hope that I shall be abel to go saturday to Bale, if I could not I would send word to Mr. Busser; but I hope and wish heartily to come. 
At Rolle I had joy with the dear peopel found Miss Jorand weak; but contented and happy. she is a fine soul and profits under the traial; while Marie <Monnard>* does not seem to grow; but bears heavely her lot of peins the older she grows the less chearful and happy. I felt grieved to see and hear how she can be put down by trifels, while her friend shows always a thankful spirit.

On my way back I found at Colombier a Drotchky sent by Mr De Pourtales I spent a few hours with them, his daughter Mrs. Bardh is spending a few weeks there, she has three nice children, about 6 OC Mr De P sent us back â€¦ la gare de Colombier, two young ladies of Neuchatel who had spent the day with them, one of them was a Miss Petanel a nice christian lady. 
You are in the middle of cleaning I wish you good courage, I am ashamed to rest while you have to do so much.

 With love to all
 Yours J Gundert

love from Uranie and Fritz I come alone
