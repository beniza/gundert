 <Winter 70/71>*
Dear Jettle

When you want bath sheet for papa they are in the bottom of the Almira where the day shirts are at the left hand. How is Stadtf√ºrster? I have just paid a visit to Mrs Director who is still in bed; but can mouve herself much better than yesterday, she was eating her dinner with good appetite, and Miss Kern at the little tabel eating too, having heard that her Aunt was in bed she came to see her and will soon return; it is but a short visit; one may may hope that Mrs S. will soon get up, Mrs Verner with whom I have dined sends you hearty love so Miss Shott. Many thanks for the Zwiebach, the stockings I have asked are not to be sent pr post it is soon enough when papa comes next week. I might also want my tipet dress as it is so warm. At the end of the week David shall send his wash and ours, we have not much, your wash will be so small that Marie could well give hers along, as we have the machine two half day one must have three women, the one by the machine, the Lingenheil send another one perhaps the widow Fohl who gets potatoes from us Rickele knows her, but Rickely can make as she thinks best. I fear I shall not be abel to come,

Excuse my miserable notes; but one must every moment move Much love to all 
Kisses to dear Marie and her pets
 yours J. G.
love to Rikele
