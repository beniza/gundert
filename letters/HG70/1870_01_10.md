 <Ca. 10-12 Jan 70>*
Dearest Marie

I was very sorry to hear that our dear Charls was again so ill, and had such a bad night, may God give you the strength you want for body spirit and soul and to our dear Charles peace and joy in the faith of the pardon of sins.

Please give dear Mama Isenberg my love and thanks for the big s... she has sent us, love also to dear Jetthen and to Peregrina when one writes to her. 
Your dear Theodor has been truly brave and lovely the few days I had him alone, I found it quite easy to lead him, now and then he tried to lead me; but found Grossmama not so weak as to be ruled, and we went on very well together. Whe<n>* Mrs Sheffel comes to Stutgart thank her for her love and cares to Theodor all the peopel in the house do what they can for him, he walks every day, he has good appetite, he is of good humour, he said to day I shall soon go to Stutgart when my papa is well again.

Now dear children may God bless you, help you in time of need according to His promise with love
 yours J. G.
