My dear Children.

Many thanks for your well come note of the 21 Sept. I was glad to hear that dear Tines hands are pretty well. I hope that they will remain so during the winter,

On my return from Boll I found the beautiful neckhankerchief which my daughter sends me, it is a real beauty. and I shall adorn myself with it in great occasions, I thank dear Tine heartily.

You have heard already the sad news about our dear Paul my heart brakes when I think of him, had he peace in God it would be easyer to bear the ilness. I trust the Lord will soon give him light with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. In Boll I found a Miss Zeslein who knew you well in Bale you went often in their house, she loved you well, and sends you hearty salutations. Your dear Marle finds no flowrs more in the garden; but soon snow to make balls. Julia likes to go to school, is Marle not jalous? but she will soon go also herself.

Our dear peopel in Stutgart send you hearty kiss to each of you, and would like as well as we to see you all. Grand Mama has the gout in the left hand so that she cannot use it well; but she is always chearful, Aunt Reiniger is well, the dear Plebsts well and very happy. Eugenia Mohl was there rather ill one fears she is consomptive she is very nice really pious, she has returned to Bre. <Barmen>* she liked Boll very much. Now I must say Adieu to you all with hearty kiss to each of you
 yours J Gundert
