Dear Jettle

Many thanks for your note through Louise Zahn.

Paul is heute like yesterday, the night was not good, some stomach ach, Anna and Charles Wei√ü have just brought many good things for Paul here in Diaconnishouse, and she asked me to send from Calw Zwiebach for Caroline who cannot bear other food. So I pray you dear Jettle be so good and send her a good box of Zwieback she said for one Fl; but put as much as you can I am glad to be able to give her some thing, they do much for Paul, please send them as soon as possibel, You need not write only adress the box to Anna or Caroline.

If Paul continues to be as he is now I shall come DV thursday after noon so that I may see him still from 10 to 11 ocl <Donn 10/11 kam liebe Mutter heim>*

Much love to dear papa and all in the house
 Yours affectly
