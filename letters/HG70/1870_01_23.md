 Calw 23d January 70
Dearest Marie

It is already pretty long since I wrote you, I was glad to hear that dear Chales is pretty well at least tolerabel.

Theodor was with me during church, he was very nice and brave; but our Dorle he does not like, it is good that he is not often with her. 
So I send you your box that you may get work as you have none more! We send also the cloth theodor got from Mrs. Herman from Liebenzel and all that which is not necessary for Theodor. As you have taken an house you must have all your things.

We wait anxiously for news from Frederic <(kamen Montag Vormittg)>1. How is dear Mama Isenberg who had a catarrh I send her love as well as to Jetthen, I hope you have a good time learning to look to the Lord alone and expecting all from Him. With love and kisses to you three
 Yours J G.
