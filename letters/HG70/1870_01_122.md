Dearest Elisabeth

This time I had no note from you; however heard yours to your own peopel, I was grieved to see by the letter of Samuel that Sister Diez is not toward you as she should be, she is by nature troken, dry and one has to learn to understand her in order to live happy together I think you should tell her in what she is wrong she may have then grace to see and know it, you must by all means try to keep communion together; for the devil might spoil much if you both give way to bitter thoughts against each other, not only for your own souls; but also for the work it self. for those near you feel soon these things and thereby the prayers are hindered.

We expect Jetthen who is bringing Theodor again; for his papa is less well and can not bear the noise of the unrulled boy, who seams to have no regard for dear Grossmama she is too good for him who requires a strong hand over him.

I thank you dear daughter for all your cares and love to my dear Frederic We suppose that he is on his way home and long to see him in our midst
