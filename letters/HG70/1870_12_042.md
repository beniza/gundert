 Calw 4th Dec 70
 <R. 7/11 Decb>*
My dear Frederic

By the letter of Mr. Inspector we heard that your health is better than in the begining you were there.

Theodor Herman is some what better, The postmeister were in troubel about their Alex; but yesterday they got a letter from him that he was sorry to have come too late for the battle he was sentinel at the time his parents were not sorry, a man from Calw is light woonded one of Stamheim too, All the others are well of course one does not know as yet of the two last gefecht which were against the WÃ¼rtembergers; But you know by the papers more than I do.

I am only glad that none of my sons are before Paris. David is a little impatient that he has to wait so long before one calls them. it is good that he has work with Mr. Steinkopf From Paul we do not hear much except that he had bad nights on account of a companion in his room who snored he asked then whether he could not come home! I hope that by this time he has a quiet sleeper with him. or perhaps alone in a room. It is very cold here the windows full of flowers. Theodor came to ask me whether I had not a sledge from one of you to give him, all the boys have, he alone has none. If it is so cold in Christmas you will not be abel to come. When you see the Busser again give them my love

With love and kiss
 Yours J. G.
