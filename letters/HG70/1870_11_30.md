Dear Paul

Here with the shirts which Jettle brought me, David shall send me yours and his own wash on saterday 3d December, as you get frish ones please to send me the three shirts which you have in use now.

I was very glad to hear from Jettle that you feel some what better specially that you have a stool on the day in which you have no injection or lavement. You had again Bangichkeit it comes probably from the nerves which have been iritated by the wine,

I am sorry to hear that you perspire again three shirts at night, but it will also come right in its time

Please send also the white flanell which you have put on these last weeks, Halstuch, handt√ºch etc

 With best wishes
 Yours J G.
