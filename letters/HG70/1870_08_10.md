Dearest Elisabeth

Many thanks for yours of 23 June I was very glad to hear that after your return from Coimbatoor you felt stronger and hoped to be abel to take a share in the work, The Commity has been very gracious to you allowing you to go where it may be best for your health, it is certainly much. 
I am very sorry to hear that you found dear Mrs. Hodges so unkind to the natives, they have done formerly much for our Mission were hearty friends to all of us; but I know that the Plymouthiens do not help usually missions as they think that the work should be led in a different way than it is. If peopel will find fault with the different instruments, they have it is true often occasion to be displised and discouraged to give their monney for the work; but what! those who give should give to the Lord and those who work, work to the Lord alone, for such who really have but the Lord in vieu and His glory He will surely care for them, through society or without. 
You are of course anxious about us in our present state, all about the war you hear from others, and praise God with us who has kept us till now from our fearful enemies. The believers and those who fear God come often for prayer together in Churches and meetings, May God turn this troubel for the coming of His kingdom and His Glory

Adieu dear Children
 yours J. G.
