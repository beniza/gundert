 Calw 19th January 1870
My dearest Frederic

As papa think that a letter may still reach you in Aden <Suez>1 I join a few lines to assure you that we long to see you in our midst to comfort you and care for you. you are continually in our minds and conversations and I doubt not that our dear Lord cares for you in every way during your journey, and above all so blesses the trial for your own soul that you are abel to praise God seing already fruits of it. a broken heart and a contrite spirit please the Lord, Oh I wish this spirit for our poor dear Paul, there are no greater blessings according to me than this, humbel and thankful, finding fault with onself and not with others, contented with Gods ways, and contented with men too, If we undearstand what is that: live from grace, we cannot but be thankful for every thing.

We learn to live by faith that is a wonderful thing, faith I understand little of it.

May the Lord watch over you and bring you with blessings.

With true love and hearty kiss
 yours J. G.
