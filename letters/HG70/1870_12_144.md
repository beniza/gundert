My dear children

Many thanks for your last letter, I was grieved by the former one to hear that dear Tine suffers so from constipation, have you not tried that bread with bran in Stutgart there are several bakers who sell that sort of bread which is daily more required and liked? I find also that one or two apples before going to bed with a glass of water helps much; but it must be n√ºchtern either some hours after eating or before breakfast, and avoid all that which can constipate, salted meat, chese, food made with flour, are not good. green vegetabels and fruits are wanted and drink much water. 
The news about our dear Paul you get from papa who has seen him last week. 
The state of Paris reminds one of that which is in the revelation about the great City Babilone the whore,

Julia and Mary are of course in great expectations for Christmas, 
Our Marie likes so much to make goodle and I dislike so that she takes gladly this troubel from me. I am always glad when Christmas is over. It is also true some peopel do too much in this way and spoil the blessings they might otherwise have had.

I wish you and yours a happy time in the Lord, as also blessings and new life for your congregation

With best wishes and kisses to each of you I remain in love
 Yours J. G.
