Dear Frederic

I came yesterday evening from Stutgart left our dear Paul somewhat better, I think. In spirit he is still the same as he was here, this grieves me more than the illness itself. The Dr has hope that he may be cured, it will of course take a long time; but hower it is not without hope, he takes every day a shoppen Champagne besides as much and even more red wine, of course as he feels weak he wants wine and can bear but little food. 
All our dear peopel in Stutgart are well except Caroline <WeiÃŸ>* who has schleimfever and keep the bed. I am glad to hear that <you>* like dear Inspecteur so much I love him too. his preaching are so clear so practic. I liked to hear him too. My love to all who remember me

 with love and kiss
 yours J Gundert

love from Jettle and Emelie
