Dear Emma

A few lines only to wish you or express you as well as your dear Georg, Grandmama and Tante my sincere wishes that our dear Lord would bless you richly in the next new year. He knows which blessings we specially want every one of us.

Please express my or rather our most hearty thanks to dear Mama and tante for their love and cares for David I might say and should say ye for Frederic, Paul, and every one of us. Mama and Tante have been as parents to every one of our children since 1846. May the Lord reward them. 
If the small carpet which Frederic brings along with this, can keep your feet or those of your dear partner warm I shall be glad

I have read with much joy and profit I hope the last book of Steinhofer which dear Georg has sent me, Since that I have got also Die haushaltung des Deieinigen Gottes in seinen inneren verh√§ltnissen und besondern virkungen zun heil der menschen.

I value every day more the works of this man of God, since I read these books the Bibel is for me a different book than it was, it is clearer it is life to me. I thank you still to have been the means to get them, 
Wishing you grace and peace and to your whole house I remain yours affectly  J G.

P.S. also love to Olga street
