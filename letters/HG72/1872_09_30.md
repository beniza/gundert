 Calw 30 Sept 72
Dear Julie

Very glad that this morning at last a letter came from Corcelles. We had waited for it almost a whole week and I told Jettle you had probably turned Rom Catholic and sought a refuge in a convent. Now I am glad that this has not taken place, for several reasons. We rejoice to hear of Uranies health, we only wish the weather may remain as favorable as it is at present. About the stove we shall see, if it does not soon come right I send for the Neuenbürger Man with his Alexander. Mr Auer was here and went with me to the Jünglingsverein on Wednesday. also Müller, whose daughter at Pforzh would no more know him, but when she had him once, would also no more let him go. His wife is at Stuttgart studying midwifery. Yesterday I had Miss. Stunde in church. We shall miss Elise Weitbr. she was very nice on Saturday eveng when we had her with her father and sister. Mr Lamparter the dean from Leonberg was also here and drank coffee with us in company with his wife we have plenty walks with the boys, Carl is very delightful and talks on continually, prays also for Grossmama. Thod. has now his vacation for 3 weeks. Lucy has written about her parents etc Fran‡ois goes to Florida and takes his hothouse plants along you will get it from Bale.

Plenty love to Uranie and yourself and wish for many a birthday more  from Your HG.
