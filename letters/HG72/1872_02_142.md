Dearest Frederic

Papa is to day in Pforzheim for a mission feast, last year he was there on dear Pauls death day it is to day in 8 days, I am much with him in my thoughts as it was in this time for one year, Dear Paul he is with the Lord full of joy I believe pains and grieves forgotton he injoies that which he has believed. he loved His Lord with his whole heart, We shall soon see him, meanwhile let us live to Him who has loved us, let us follow Him with a full heart!

This note will also do for my dearest David, we were glad to have again a few lines from you, we have been expecting brother Plebst the whole day; but he has not come, when Emma wrote to Marie lately she said that grandmama was unwell, it is perhaps on her account that he has not come for the yunglings Verein. We are very glad to hear that you like your present work. 
Adieu my two dear sons
 yours affectionatly JG.
