My dear children

Your last letter <(v. 30. Octob)>*, dear Herman, has given me much joie, specially when you say that you fear your self and distrust your feelings, The longing you have after the Lord after His grace and His communion is I believe from Him, His good spirit works in you and I trust that He will continue that which He has begun, if only you continue to distrust yourself and all your feelings, His word alone is to be trusted, About a deep conviction of sin - God can make it clear to you in His own time The sight of Jesus on the cross for us with all our sins upon Him can work it. Steinhofer says He has carried our sins upon Him from His baptisem He walked about with our sins upon Him as the lamb of God. We are looking forward with joy hoping that the Lord will bring us together for the good of our souls and to His praise and glory, I trust our dear daughter has no fear to come in our midst we long to see her with papa and children.

 With kisses Yours affectly
 J Gundert
