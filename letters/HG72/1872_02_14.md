Dear Children

It is already pretty long since I wrote to you, and so I have to thank for two letters of yours.

I had once the impression that you seek earnestly the Lord, it was for me an unspeakable joy so that I said the last shall be the first; but since some time (though you show me more love than formerly) I feel sad about you, for, if that which I took for a conversion then does not make progress it was no real conversion. If we have been once convinced of our intire corruption and deep sinfulness, have recieved grace to repent and believe in Jesus, behold the old things are passed and all is made new, That is the promise of the Lord, so that we can say leaving the thing which are behind I run to the price set before, Christ Himself becomes our life so that we look daily for His appearing being sure that we shall appear with Him in Glory, because He is our life now. Do you believe and feel that Christ is your life, this is performed in us by the Holy spirit and it must encrease, the peace and joy of the Lord banishes that which is old, our own thoughts and imagination must give way to the spirit if God, which renews us to the image if our crusified Lord, are we dead and burried with Him, we shall also live and rule with Him, improuvements regeneration without the foundation cannot go on, In the cross of Christ is our glory, Now I have but time to say Adieu. If I mistake regarding the state of your mind, do not take amiss the few words of your mother who loves you all and with kisses to each of you remain

 yours aff
 JG.
