Dearest Frederic

You will have been waiting anxiously for some news of papa as I was too; but we are still expecting the Inspector, and meanwhile are looking to our Lord, without whom nothing can be done or should be done, We are very glad to hear that dear Mr Buser is getting on nicely, one of the daughters <wrote:>1 the praying sympathy of the two Mr Gundert does us good, You might perhaps just now show your love and thankfulness, with a bottle of Champaner Wain, as usually the convalessants may require; <Ich bezweifle ob das wohl angebracht wäre>1

Marie has much tooth ache is swollen on the side of the right cheek. Theodor likes to go to school and works his tasks well. We are much with you in thoughts, and sigh for you

Adieu dear Son
 Yours affectly J. G.

Could you not send me once a paquet of tracts to distribute to the poor? with leave of the Inspector of course

2Dearest Frederic

In buying the cloth for David I paid a visit to the Würzes, who were kind as usual, she excused themselves for having been unabel to arrange the things in a more favorable way or so little adventagoues for you; but regarding the present state of things in our days they could really not do better, The wool is extreemely dear, the peopel at work have all agreed to require more pay and have sent him a petition. Altogether the things are not going on very well it appears. If the Lord gives you a place in the Mission we shall thank Him. We are still expecting the Insp All our peopel are in Stamheim for the feast

Adieu dear Son
 Yours J. G
