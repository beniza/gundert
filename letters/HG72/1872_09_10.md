 <Calw 10 Septbr 72>*
Dear sons Frederic and David

As I hear from Uranie that she cannot leave Corcelles before the 10th October I do not like to be absent from home beyond three weeks so we shall not come to Bale before the 21 that is one week later than you wished, I am sorry for it; but Uranie must be there till that time on account of Fritz Fillinger things for which she is responsabel. A week is not so very long. from the 23 or 24 David can still see much of Neuchatel and Geneve if he wishes, is it not? How do you do dear sons? I do not know which is your indian stick describe it please. For my own self I would have much prefered to go now to Bale and Corcelles and return soonner before it be cold and the days so short; but it cannot be helpd. Sa in many things we must renounce to our own wishes and think that it is right with God and with men, Our good Lord is doing all well and right through faith we say yes it is good and well let only my Lord be glorified

Adieu my dear sons
 yours affectly J.G.

Can you go to Corcelles on the 23 monday or tuesday 24?
