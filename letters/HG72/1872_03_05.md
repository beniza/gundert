Dearest Frederic,

What shall I wish you on your birthday? perhaps that which I am ardently wishing for my self that is to learn what is that, live upon grace from moment to moment, take, recieve from the fulness of our rich Lord grace for grace that's a happy life for body, soul and spirit; live from grace, all cares and uneasiness is banished away. I see I feel how beautiful it must be so to live; I salute it from a far, longing heartily for its possession and injoyement.

You also wish it is it not? that requires faith with waiting upon the Lord, in such state of grace humility and thankfulness is exercised and increased, self I must decrease that grace may rule and abound.

Give my love to dear David, This morning as Carl came for the prayer with his mama he said I will not be lieb, but after some words of love from grandpapa he did as the son who had at first refused to go work in the vinyard of his father and still went. he can be most amiabel and lovely. he sits often on my shemele with sissors cutting paper which is his favorite amusement. Now dear son wishing you a happy day and year with a kis  yours JG.
