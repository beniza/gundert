Dearest Frederic

Many thanks for all the news which you give us, This time of expectation delai and waiting will surely bear fruit to Gods praise, between hopes and distrust through disapointement our faith get knocks as Hebich said and thereby is encreasing if at least we let our Lord work and our eyes and mind remain under changes and trembling fixed upon Him who makes all things right and good. He has pity with us our Lord; but seeing all in a right light He must deal against our wishes and feelings often, however one day we shall say He has done all right, already by faith and obedience we say so too. Much love to dear David and the Buser,
 yours affectly JG.
