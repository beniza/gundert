 Calw 23 Sept 72
My dear wife

You will have had a cold night to Bale, in fact on Sund I began to fire a little and today the oven made me a fine room. We had yesterday a visit from Cath Müller and her bridegroom Groß a nice man of 36 y. already much exercised in his calling by having been employed in Hesse, Esthland etc. He pleased us much. I was at Hirsau where Mrs Weinmann turned out to be Mr Groß' aunt. He is also related to Lörcher in China.

Your Sunday text was a good one I trust it was true as regards Fred's journey on that day.

We heard not yet from you, but I think this rejoices you at Corcelles, where I only trust you will find it warmer than here. This morning I saw some Reif on Seeger's roof. Poor grapes!

Herm's letter etc you may send but to Bale, perhaps also Jette's. 
The room will today be finished as far as the chief matter goes. 
Plenty love to you both. Harry will I hope soon hear where he has to go, he is dreadfully excitable and turns P round his finger. Thod also complained of him as having beaten him etc I played chess with him, but he went on incessantly talking without thinking much. The Lord keep you all including dear Uranie
 your HG
