Dearest Frederic

It is pretty long since I wrote you or to David, however I am with you in the spirit and can but pray that our Good Lord would arrenged the things for you so that His name be praised and your soul prospere before Him, Should the things be arranged with the WÃ¼rzes it would not be very smooth nor without some anxiety; but what there are difficulty everywhere so that the joy shall be mixed. own house, own partener, but new cares Well our cares are to be put on the Lord who cares for us, Adieu dear son  Yours J. G.


Dearest David

Many thanks for your last few lines. Thats right that you are learning French so diligently Uranie will be glad to see you once in Corcelles when you may talk with her the language which she undearstand. which of the Miss Buser knows the best french? It is possibel that our Oberpostmeister shall go to Canstatd. One has already called once for Alex to be officier; but his parents and the Gentlemen where he is have beged to leave him longer in Desten*, I hope you shall be left quiet at Bale. With good wishes and kiss  Yours JG.
