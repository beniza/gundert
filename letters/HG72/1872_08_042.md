Dear Children

It seems to me that we hear seldom from you, that is from my dear Freddy, well I understand the reason and I bear with him wishing him faith and trust in our good Lord with patience.

And you dear David I thank heartile for the many notes you kindly wrote during my illness. By Gods grace I am again nicely, nearly as well as before except my nerves which are still weak.

Jettle has left us yesterday for Stutgart from where she goes to morrow monday to Barmen. Yesterday evening came the Missionary Zimmerman with two sons just as we had at supper Ulrich Zwingle with his wife Marie B. Mrs WÃ¶hrle and Lamparder came too

Now Adieu my dear sons Wishing you peace and joy in the Lord 
 Yours affectly JG.

Dear F you do not forget the tracts you have promissed me
