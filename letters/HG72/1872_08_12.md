My dearest Jettle

Many thanks for your little note accompanying your Aunts <SÃ¼skind>* letter, she will have been glad to get it, She came on Friday here from L. the good lady pretendes that you have been away a very long time, she said "the last time I was here Jettle was already gone." Marie had troubel to convince her that you were here had even accompanied her with Carl and that you had visited her at L. at last she rememberd and was much pleased when I told her that after your return from B. you would spend a few days with her, she is well, did not grudge the monney which she had been obliged to pay at L the house lady made her to pay for four weeks although she had been but three weeks Mrs. Kleckpfer was furious at it but Tante not she got a fine bouquet in revenge from the Mme which Aunt kept as a dear remembrance. She longed to return to Kornthal and related how good she had it there, Mrs. Vernier has written such nice letters, with such heimweh, as if she could no longer live without her Aunt, she will I dare say value her home there a great deal more than before, Once she said "it was a nonsense that I made this journey, it is the last in my life"

Mrs. Herman has lost her cough and is well,
