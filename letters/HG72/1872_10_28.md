 <28 October 1872>*
My dear Frederic

I am much with you in my mind all this time, I wish I could take a part of your cares and anxiety; and I can but ask my Lord to do it. He can and will, what is my sympathy and feelings how ever deep they may be compared to the one of our High prist, who toke upon Himself the nature of man and can be touched or sympathize with our infirmities; but without sin He has pity with us, and bear us, He will also help and make all right so that we shall have ground to praise Him. Only we must now learn to wait upon Him, this waiting upon Him shall be rewarded specially if we do it without murmering and impatience, as it were by force, of course nature will have her right; but by grace it is subdued and brought to the foot of the cross. I hope that we shall see you here after some time on your way to H., 
Adieu my dear
 yours JG
