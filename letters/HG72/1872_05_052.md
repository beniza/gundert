1Dear Frederic

These last days you did not write to us. We expected to hear about Mr. Johanes after whom we have "heimweh". You are sorry to have to quit your room; so it is in this world, if we cleave to the Lord very firm and He be our joy these disapointments are but small things and turn to us a blessing if we take them well.

We are very thankful to hear that dear Mr. Buser is better.

We feel much for you that you are to exercise patience for the we too learn with you and for you, but hope let us not to be ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, when patience and hope seam to vanish away the Love of Jesus refresh us again so that we are abel to say after Abraham exempel we will hope against hope. The Love of Jesus yes thats our life May our dear Lord fill your heart with it so that joyfully you wait upon Him who never decieves us, through faith and hope we shall over come 
 Adieu my dear son
