Dearest Marie

We were glad to get a letter from you, Your box or coffre came yesterday. I went to see the Lamparders yesterday who were still in Eslingen, from Mrs. Lotholz I hear that Mrs. WÃ¶hrle is not yet well, her leg pains her still. I would have gone to see her; but the road is very bad. I trust I shall go to morrow.

We were enchanted to hear that the boys behaved so well and thereby deserved creuzerle I send a kiss to each specially to dear Carl on his birthday. We had seen by the papers the devastation in Tubingen and still more elswhere!

All the news here or about us you get in abundance from Jettle and papa. So with much love to all your dear friends as well as ours I remain yours affectly
 J. Gundert
