Dearest Frederic

This bit of paper will remind you of Stutgart from which place you have send it to us. Now you are going to have David near you, and soon your good friend Fromayer. It is Pauls birthday, I am still much with him in my thoughts, In this time for one year I was with him in Stutgart. Dear son he has now learnt much with the Lord, could we hear him he would say I think: Learn to know the Lord to trust and believe Him fully and, follow Him where ever He goes faithfully Hear His voice and become as a child. Dear Paul his course of fighting has soon be to end; but it has been a hard fight; for he ment and would follow his Lord fully, he is fully, perfectly redeemd bodily perhaps too.

I hope that you are happy my dear Son, and do not care too much for the future, He our Lord who has cared so wonderfully for you shall lead you and arrange every thing for you, but you must trust Him and honour Him by believing Him and His word

On the 2d of February we shall go to Nagold for the Mission conference, We have invited Emma H to come along, she would have accepted of the offer with much pleasure; but her papa does not like it on account of the small pox which is raging in Nagold, In the surounding villages there is much of it and of the black sort more dangerour than the other,

The news will David tell you all, papa is in Tubingen he is himself not very well, has fever at night

Now adieu Be so kind as to send the letter and Enveloppes to Uranie 
 With love your
 J Gundert
