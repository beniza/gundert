My dear Herman

My last note to you is already as it were an answer to yours lately recieved. I thank you for it though it grieves me to the heart. I felt well that it is not right with your soul toward God, but did not think you were in such confusion, You are not einfeltig but vielfeltig and God will have us einfeltig, the difference between you and us is that we are poor sinners who know and believe that we have deserved Gods wrath and ferdamniss, and we believe from the heart that our blessed Lord has borne the wroth and chatisement which we have merited. he the Lord Jesus has paid my debt, has borne my sins on the cross, crucified them in His flesh and by His woonds I am healed this belief ferm belief makes me very thankful towards my redeemer He who has loved me to death yea to the death of the cross deserves my whole heart, He is my life He is mine and I am His own I know that He is a living God and Saviour and from the fulness of His grace I wish to live from moment to moment. my greatest desire is to honour and Glorify Him in abiding in Him for with out Him, that is without a constant communion with Him I can do nothing, If you do not know by experience and knowlege of yourself that you are a poor sinner you may believe that which the word of God says of our hearts, but dear son what is the use for me to tell so much you are a learned man and know all these things from the head, your heart must be changed, I can only pray my Lord to give you a longing a prayer for the Holy spirit He shall make these things clear to you; Your dear Christine who is less confused than you understands likely better, Oh may the Lord Jesus give you light. Give you His holy spirit and make you einfeltig so that you no more argue through unbelief, but humble your self to the foot of the cross and accept the salvation made for you

I love you not less than I did dear Son I wait for the work of the Lord in you if you allow it and wish it. All that which you say about wife and children interests us much I send them as well as to you a kiss  Yours J.G.
