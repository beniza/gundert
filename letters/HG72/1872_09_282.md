Dearest Jettle

My hearty thanks for your good letter, If the silinder cannot be got for the oven I shall be nearly glad for Uranie and yourself. as it is healthier Uranie tells me that she shall most gladly pay it, when I spoke of 100 and some fr she said that it was very cheap she had to pay here 200 fr for one I am very sorry for all your troubel dear friend.

All the friends salute you very heartily. News I venture not to give as Marie has the talent for it. The grapes are not ripes as yet, it is rather cold and your good warm shawl has been very useful also to David on the steamer, in Rolle Miss Ruynat had fire in the chimny which I injoyed much. 
I do not write more as my hand is already tired, Give please my love to all in the house but specially to dear Elise Weitbrech wishing her peace and joy; How is Resele Kappler? give her my love and others, till now we have found neither bonne nor femme de chambre. Adieu ma trŠs chŠre  ta Julie G
