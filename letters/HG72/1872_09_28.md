Dear papa

Many thanks for your well come letters, All the news about our journey you have of course from Marie. I found Uranie better than last year, so did I find Marie Monnard and Miss Jorand. Mrs Ruynat Gave us the dinnar the three days we were in Rolle to evoied the troubel of it to Marie. At last dear Samuel is coming round. So D. V. we shall see Herman with his family. We did not feel the cold on our way to Bale, but in Bale and in Rolle I felt it very much less here as the rooms are small and the sun shining in, The children are returning monday 30th to Bale and Uranie with me on the 10th Oct. she does not think that it would be necessary to rest one day in Bale however I think to stay one day account of Frederic who would not like to see us only a few hours, We have still time about it We were all very thankful to get your letters in coming from Rolle, Adieu dear papa with love from U and to all
 yours JG
