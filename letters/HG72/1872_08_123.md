 12th monday <August 1872>*
Dear Frederic

I thank you very much for all the tracts you have kindly sent me. I am glad to have them, I will give a part to Mr Schn√ºrle who distribute them with understanding and I hope that they may prove to be a blessing for the readers and the Mission, Yesterday Adolph with Samele, Gustave with wife were here to see the exhibition, the first said that he remembers you and is looking out for a passing place for your future; but of course it may elapse a certain time before one finds any thing propre, He was glad to have found you quiet and waiting on God as you were in Stutgart. 
Emma is to go at the end of this week to Stutgart to take care of Mrs Werner house and child for a few days during the time she <Mrs W> is getting rest and new teeth,

We hope that you wait on the Lord this present time of learning might help you for your whole life

 adieu my dear Son
 Yours JG
