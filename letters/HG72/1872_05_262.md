 <26 Mai 1872>*
Dearest Frederic

These days I wanted to write you but had the feeling of Johab when a young man wanted to run and tell the news to the King Johab said to day there are no good news remain rather. I was somewhat prepared, however to learn to wait quietly upon the Lord must be exercised, papa can tell you in a few words how it is, I can only pray the Lord to make His love His communion so swet so exceedingly great to you that you may say with full confidence my Lord cares for me He sleeps not and is not indifferent nor slow in His inquiries for my. With Him all shall be right. The more one has to wait, the better usually it goes.

I feel for you dear son; but can only pray. The Inspector has allowed me to take from Weitbr as many tracts as I will so I am provided.

 Adieu dear Son yours JG.
