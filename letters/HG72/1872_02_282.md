Dear Children

In your last you said nothing about dear Tinnes health so that I hope she is continuing to improve The few lines of Julia to her mama have pleased us well. You write us very diligently I thank you for it. I am reading with great delight the works of Steinhofer since I have them I understand papas explanations of the Bibel better than I did, and I read the Bibel with much more joy and profit to my soul. I know and experience that it is the bread of life. Jesus the word which has been made flesh that flesh we are to eat and drink his blood; without eating it we have no life. The Jews murmered at these words of our Lord and those who have not accepted the Lord by faith in His full redemption are doing like the jews though they bear the name of Christ, Do you remember once before you went to America we were talking on religion Tante Emma and you and myself. I said that a christian is to die to himself in order to live to Jesus, You were displeased at it, even angry so that Tante and myself said poor young man he must learn this, what will he then teach others about the way of life, how is it now? Has Paul not told the truth dead and burried with Christ to live through Him to His praise and glory. Dear Son be not displeased with me look I love you and I feel the want to know more of your inward life.

With hearty love to all and kisses
 yours J.G.
