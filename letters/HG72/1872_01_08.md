My dear Children

I have to thank for a long letter you have kindly sent with descriptions of house and family.

I hope that you had a happy Christmas and new year, if our days are spent with the Lord in His communion, the feast days make no great difference the chief joy is and must be in the Lord else I have no life nor do we get any through feast days, the world and so calld christians have spoiled and corrupted every thing, all is material and the outward things leave no room for that which is spiritual, of course one speaks and sings godly things; but where is the life and the reality. one live or see in darkness and one is blinded so that one make no difference more betwee the world and chistians. How will it be when the Lord come how shall such dead christians look up with joy for the full redemption, Oh dear children if you have gone out of Sodom of the world look not behind less you be condemnd with the World, We must go out of Babilon else we shall be partakers of its plagues. We have been redeemed with a hightprice therefore we have to live to Him who died for us May we have grace to do that this new year

Do you see or hear of conversion in your congregation

With love and kisses to each of you
 yours J G.
