Dear children

<(I Brf v. Mama seit ihrer Krankheit)>*

Many thanks for several letters full of love and sympathy, The Lord has been very gracious to me during the illness I had no pains, and now I feel nearly as strong and well as I was before,

Your Julie is writing very nicely in English she may soon be your secretaire and help her Mama when papa is absent, Marie has perhaps more taste for the house hold than for study

With us things are very dear Beef 22 cr per pound bread 5 1/2 creu per pound, one egg two creuser Butter 34 or 36 cr. One hoped that when the railway would be finished, having so less foreiners amongst us it would be cheaper; but it has not deacrased nor will it as one say. Your dear wife who is such a good house keeper may like to know our prices, cloth, thread every things are in the same manner higher than formerly. Now with a kiss to each of you I remain
 Yours J. G.
