 <22 April 1872>*
My dear Frederic

These last weeks you are in troubels, we think much of you, and hope that all will end in peace with the Würzes, that is not be offended if you do not agree with them. Now patience is wanted and a constant looking on the Lord who surely shall care for you in His time only His time is to be looked for with patience and hope, when ever I thought of the Würzes regarding you I felt the need to say. Lord lead us not in to temptation; but let thy good will be done.

You see already that to care for a single person is easier than for two; thats the begining of the cares in a maried life. it requires more faith, more confidence in the Lord for in no time the one or the other may be tried and so both suffer; but also the joy of the one is for both, How is your health does it not affect your nerves? Mr. Frohnmajer is glad to see you soon, let your fellowship be in the Lord and for edification 
Adieu dear Son
 Yours J. G.
