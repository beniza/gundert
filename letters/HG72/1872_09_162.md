Dearest Frederic

Many thanks for your news I trust the Lord will make all right for your future; but we were all astonished that you thought of coming to see after your box which contains but shirts and things which are of no importance now, you shall have time enough to see them when it is once settled; 
We hope to see you monday morning before I leave Bale, Are you going to Heidelberg saturday or sunday morning? I wish to know it, as we wish to see you before you go. We have not heard from dear David.

I hope you have grace to put on the Lord all your cares believing that He shall and will make all right that which concern you. It is a hard thing for us to trust our Lord fully, the heart is wicked and decietful above all. Our Good Lord must have much patience and long suffring with us, who are so distrustful and unbelieving, and even displeased and murmering if He does against our wishes. He the only wise who will our best, but we are short sighted, looking to that which is present May the Lord give you peace and quietness in Him.

Adieu my dear Children
 yours JG.
