 <Calw 6 Jan 72.>*
Dear Frederic

You may imagine how glad I was in hearing that dear Emma as well as her family are disposed towards you, I think that the Lord is very gracious to you having now made your heart at ease without any affort or exertion on your part nor on ours, The Lord has seen that you tried to keep quiet leaving Him your concern, take it a token that if you leave Him every thing He shall care for you tenderly, fatherly and wonderfully. It is a great thing to learn to trust the Lord in all things, and remain very quiet, full hope set on Him alone. May our Lord give you this grace for the future, in great and small things. We are thankful and joyful for you

Adieu dear Son yours
 J Gundert
