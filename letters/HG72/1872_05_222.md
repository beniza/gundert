Dear children

Your last letter telling us of the illness of your both children has of course made us anxious, how glad would we be to be abel to help dear Christine in nursing the dear girls, in their sickness which is of such nature that it requires the greatest care. Our Marie has bears still the consequence of the fever she had at Stutgart, she does not hear well on ear and it has still matters coming out, I made myself often reproches to have cared too little during the illness, for instance leaving the windows open for a while or such things. However how is it with poor peopel who can not care, and have not the means wanted. God cares for them very wonderfully so that one can see wonders. The whole depends how we stay with God; if we can hear His voice and be attentive to know what He has to tell us. He can remove the trial in a short time. We are much with you in thoughts. May the Lord do more than we ask and know to ask.

with true and warm sympathy and expectation to hear soon and kisses to every one of you

 yours affectly
 J Gundert
