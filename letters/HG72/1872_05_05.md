Dear Papa

You have a cold and rainy day for your journey. The Plebsts went after dinar to Buhlach, if it was fine weather would go from there to Efringen, where Emma wishes much to go; as it rains I doubt they will go. This after noon I went to church and heard helfer's catekisation, passabel for believers. It makes me always sad to see and hear such confirmation; No letter came to day. The two sisters of Rikele paid her a visit, came walking and returned on foot, they brought good news from home, the father can work again. I hope you will be abel to sleep a little this night else you might feel very uneasy for the duty of the day. May the Lord strengthen you of body soul and spirit and give you out of His fulness abundent grace. 
Monday the Plebsts have not come, Marie gives you all the news, from Herman nothing better the same of Elisabeth! poor Children God alone can help and will help in His own good time, No news from Bale. Adieu, peace and joy, have you slept a little

 Yours affectly J. G.
