Dearest Frederic

Yesterday I saw Mrs Emma who was very friendly gave me even a kiss, Uranie was much pleased to see her and wish for you that you might soon be together, I wish it too; but we must wait on Gods good time He, the only wise who cares for his children with regard to their Eternal welfair, and not for the present only as we are all inclined to do. We want much grace so to live that the Lord be the first and the last in all our doing and thinking the time is short therefore needfull for us to watch and pray so that God be glorified.

Aunt Uranie salutes you and thanks both of you still if David has not time to inquire after the boxes as I tell him in his note, please then to be so kind and do it yourself

 Adieu dear son
 Yours J. G.
