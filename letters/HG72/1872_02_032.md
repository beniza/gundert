 Calw 3d February [1872]
Dearest Frederic

Yesterday we were in Nagold, where pretty many peopel had come troz the poken, it was nice, Helfer Elseser spoke nicely on the words "worket as long as it is day" then Verner from Efringen spoke rather long I did not understand him well; then papa finished with several remarks on the different fields of the mission, and a very good prayer, specially that God would send fitted and propre, useful labourers in His work.

Yesterday and today I have thought more on the words of the Lord, "had you faith as a grain of mustard you would tell to this mountain be remouved in the sea and it would be so, There are often such mountains before us about which we say with the women who shall remouve the big stone from before the grave. A big mountain has God remouved before you, shall He not remouve the others? perhaps He will require more faith; but only faith, prayer and faith are to be exercised; an action would be sooner done, and even easier than to exercise faith; but God will have it. It is a daily exercise and experience in it makes us bold and confident in our Lord whose words are all true

Adieu dear son
 yours affectly JG.
