My dear Children [Samuel]

It seems to me to be a long time since I have written to you, we are however not so strangers; for we love one an other and are often in spirit together at least when we pray for each other. In seing the little ones of Marie and Emma we think of yours, he would probably love his Grandpapa as much as these two do if he could see him and feel his love Liesele is inchanted with him she likes especially to get the last spoon ful of his caffee, she opends already before hand her mouth to get her portion, Herman Hesse is some what spoiled or fancys himself neglected if not always carryd about, his illness is the cause of it, but so are all children after having been cared for during an illness, as for me I cannot carry him he is too heavy, Adelle is a very fine child not exigent at all, she can amuse herself with any thing. Julia is not so good, she can scream if not near her mother, Theodor and Carl we do not see often Carl is such a dreamer that he sees no one enter the room with out taking notice of any one, but he learns very well,
