My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your kind note of the 20th Sep. We rejoice with you at any small manifestation of life which appear in your congregation, surely it will appear one day, and that seed sown in many sighs will spring up to the glory of Him who workes the will and doing,

Our two boys <Fr und D.>* have gone to Stutg, they are full of zeale for the Verein and work hard, we have only to pray that God would keep them and lead them Frederic specially goes a little quick in business in him I see my wicked nature which wants to be kept back like a wild horse to day specially I feel how much they want to be kept by the Lord, so to deal that they give no offence and be guided in all that which is to be done for the future.

David is nice and more communicatif than formerly, yesterday in putting his things in order as he had arrived. I said I hope you will marry one day, which was rather bold of me as formerly, if a word was spoken about it he became angry saying no, but yesterday he said gently, "I must first see how I get my livelyhood"

The Lord who has done every thing so well hitherto will lead us well till the end, looking daily for His coming. Much love from Uranie to you all and from me to my dearest Tine and each of you a kiss
 yours JG.
