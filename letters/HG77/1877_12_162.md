My dear Children [Hermann]

Already Christmas in a few days, were you near us we would spend it together however we are together in mind, and we hope that you will have a happy season in the new home, and in the congregation. for after all there is no joy like that to see new life in the young and old ones, The life of Jesus He gives it richly abundently, if we will loose our own

We shall soon hear how many fine presents the dear Children have got from papa and Mama. We old peopel are doing nothing at all, we give to each child a piece of money and the parents buy what they like for the little ones I have not been accustomed to think how to rejoice others with presents and I cannot learn it now, I am too glad to have nothing to think, I feel that I am getting old and I injoy rest as often as I can have it, however in winter one has much to do as the days are short, till 10 oc the morning I am about doing my daily work, Since Uranie is with us I am less free; she cannot dress or undress herself alone, I also go out less as she finds the time long, if alone; With her and our two English girls there are things which would appear to me to be a burden, if I did not know this is necessary for my spiritual education,

We are glad to have for our dear Frederic a fit person to help him in Miss Buser he had too much to do one could see him sighing and bent under the burden, as the work did accumulate. She is Frederike Buser fit for the work and very modest. She lives vis a vis in Seegers house au plein pied, they are two sisters, this one had helped the fathers to make plans and writing, the youngest Louise gives Clavir lessons, the Weitbrecht are not inchanted to see some body beside Fred; but he <d.i. Weitbr>* does so very little that pour Son* <Friedrich>* could not go on, they would have liked to see one of their own person to help; but there are none. Elise the only unmarried is always ill, dear Frederic as well as we all have to put up with several annoying things, but God helps Frederic under it with patience and waiting

With a tender kiss to Mama children and yourself love from Uranie  Yours JG.
