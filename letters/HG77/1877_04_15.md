My dear Children [Hermann]

We were glad to see by your last letter that the cold which you had some weeks ago was not worst but better. You have had terrible storms it appears with snow and lightnings, we had but little of it, only it was strikening to see snow and thunders at the same time. We are glad that the season is over in which you have so much to do and hope with you that it is not in vain your labours amongst the children, the Lord shall make the seed which you now sow to spring up in His own time, what He requires from his servants is faithfulness, a great reward is promised to the faithful; but how much we are to watch and pray to keep in the first love without which the firsts shall be the lasts One speaks much of love; but it is not easy to exercise it when it requires selfdenial. I think that it was more easy for me formerly than now. The heart is wicked and decietful above all and how often are we still cheated and decieved by it.

The news about all yours are always heard with much joy, The little one is a great favorite from all I can imagine so is Adelle, dear Julia speaks of a bruderle or schwesterle she is to get, she will I dare say feel herself neglected and perhaps be disatisfied which she can already be now and then it is good that the mother is ferme with her else she might give troubel being of a strong will.

Uranie hears your letters translated by Jettle with much joy and speaks of you all with much interest, she is suffring in her knees, walks with difficulty so that instead of going to Switzerland as she hoped in June she will have to go to Wildbad I of course must go too for her sake; We shall be glad for you when your new house be ended, we had to repair the wall behind the house as one goes in the garden this bit of work has made me to fancy what a deal of trouble you shall have with Church and house spare your health, and may God preserve you from cares and troubels. I send a hearty kiss to my very dear Tine to the dear children to yourself from me and from Uranie
 Yours affectly J. G.
