Dear Children [Hermann]

I am sitting with Uranie who is still in bed, papa and Jettle are in Stamheim where papa has to preach as the son who was his father's vicar has been called some where else; I have just paid a visit to our neighbours house where we used to buy the milk formerly perhaps Marie or Julia remember the Palmer's house, the mother died some months ago since her death, the father has declared to his 5 children that he will have no household more each of them are to get their livelyhood as they can three were already out of the house the younger one 15 with the sister 16 or 17 had to look for work, she got in a service the boy Carl went to the Cigarfabrique: and slept in the father's house, Since 15 days he is ill vomiting blood the father does nothing for him. two days ago came an other son from heilbron with an inflamation in the knee so that one had to carry him from the train, the father who is servant in Waldhorn seeing the son carried said angrily what has he to do there? why not remain where he was? So these two poor orphans are in the room where the mother died, she used to care tenderly for her children, the father has not yet come to the son who has been brought home, a good woman in the house cares for them; but she gets her bread in the fabrique in working, how to do? I have advised her to get if possible the sons in the Hospital where the father shall be obliged to pay. It grieves me much for those poor children, the mother was a nice woman who has learned to know the Lord during her long illness of the heart. the son who was brought has much fever beside the terrible pain in the knee, the good woman who has now watched two nights putting ice on the knee is a Catholic who already cared for the mother of the children Today we have had no letter from you; but it may still come, Yes dear son if Jesus is our life we have every thing in Him May He bless You in the congregation in your own family to whom Uranie and self send most hearty love with a kiss to each specially to dear Tine
 Yours affectly JG
