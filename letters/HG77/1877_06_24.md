1My dear Children [Hermann]

Last week I did not write being rather occupied and I feel some time so very tired that I leave all aside, not that I am not well; but we have a new servant girl, and Uranie requires some help,

It is nice that Julia kept the corespondance with you during your absence so diligently. her dear Mama has a great help in her, We expect every day my brother Francois with Lucy three letters are already waiting for him here, Frederic is in Neuchatel till the end of June afterward they will go on the Gournigel or some where else, his visit has left us a good impression of his spiritual state much more favorabel than formerly, he grows in the knowledge of the Lord and is less troubled with cares.

David is just with us for a visit, of course papa writes you all about our concerns, the Lord shall bring all to right patience is wanted He will guide every thing without giving offence or going our own way, Wait on the Lord quietly is no easy lesson

Much love to dear Tine to the three children, much love from Uranie, You are now at ease since you have found out which is the way God will have you, May He bless you and make you a blessing for many
 Yours affectly
