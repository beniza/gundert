My dear Children [Hermann]

It is already 4 weeks since we came from Wildbad, since that I have not written to you was however every week very glad to hear your dear letters, to see that your joy is Jesus to live for Him your first desire, gives me great joy. Yea nothing else can satisfy our hearts, Jesus the bread of life, live from Him I have just red in frensh dans le "miel d‚coulant du Rocher. Je ne saurois me rappeler sans rougir, qu'au milieu de mes plus grandes d‚votions, j'ai oubli‚ le sang de Jesus Christ, AprŠs l'image de l'enfer il n'y en a point de plus hideuse qu'un systeme de christianism d'ont Jesus Christ n'est pas la base et le centre, il nous faut, regarder comme autant de p‚ch‚s, et d‚plorer amŠrement toutes les bonnes oeuvres que nous pourions avoir faites hors de la communion du Sauveur, et par un autre principe que par amour pour Lui. Aussi bien que tout culte et toute oeuvre qui ne provient pas d'un coeur aros‚ du Sang de Jesus Christ est une oeuvre morte"

I like to read in that little book it is the same spirit as Steinhofer which after the Bibel is my food, by it I have learnt to read the word of God differently than formerly, The desire I had to know more of Jesus has been in part realised by reading Steinhofer and papas explanations of the word have become clearer and livelyer. Know Jesus live by Him et for Him is the only means of true rest and hapiness. One learns gradually to become a baby on his fathers bosom; if cares will trouble us, the promise is there "I care for you" if fears will take hold of us because evil is near; We say after Jesus lead us not into temptation; but d‚liver us from evil, This prayer I can do often when I fancy that for me or for mine house temptation may be there from men or indirect, could we see how often the roaring lion turn round us we would pray more and be on our guard then less sorrows of hearts would touch us, much and many disagreable things would be spared unto us.

Uranie is better and I feel well too, only a little fatigue I cannot bear, Papa is nicely the bathes in the river do him good

Much love from me and Uranie to dear Tine and the Children

 Yours affectly
 J. G.
