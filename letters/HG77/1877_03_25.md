Dear Children [Samuel]

I was glad to hear again from you dearest Elisabeth, you have been both tried with illness and thank God that you have been both spared, and that your eyes have not remaind weak, and that the dear baby has been in health the whole time. I can imagine the joy on each side to kiss one an other after the separation. It must be a sad time with you, poken and famine, to hear and see so much misery. We have that not; but many other things to grieve one, poverty caused often by bad conduct is and other, several have died of nervous feber, Now your are on the Mook I am glad for you, for you want rest and change of air, may the Lord restore your health to both fully, and the baby he shall get rosy cheeks and strong to walk; the family from Barmen is in Stutgart Theodore wife and children, we shall soon see them here.

It is a very long time since I saw your Mama; but I leave home as seldom as I can; I shall perhaps be obliged to go to Sweetzerland as my sister wishes to go once more to see her home and friends, She is now again as well as she was before her illness She sends you love, and please give mine to all the dear black peopel who remember us

With a tender kiss to you three
 Yours affectly J Gundert
