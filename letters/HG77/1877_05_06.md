My dear Children [Hermann]

It is some weeks since I wrote you some lines, the last fourtnight we have been very busy in cleaning the house and preparing for the Mission feast, all is over now, and we have some rest.

The question of Mr Mogling will have put you in some difficulty; and we can but pray our Lord to guide you to do His will, I feel quiet about it the words of John <1 Joh>* III-21.22. inabled me to be calm in confidence; as I feel that my heart condemn me not; but His will shall be done May He give you light and full assurence on the way you are to go, and to us full submission assured He shall send the propre person.

May our Lord keep you in quietness of soul and show you soon what may be His will Much love to my dear Tine to your three daughters
 Yours afftly JG

much love from Uranie
