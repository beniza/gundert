My dear Children

Today again came good news from you except that your finger is still paining, with you as with us there comes again and again new causes for prayer and happy are we to know that we are wellcome by our Lord with all sorts of petitions, pains of souls and body are heard for us and ours, Your dear Emmale is as dear to us as Julia and Adele and we represent her to our mind with you all She will have opened her eyes to see the Christmastree; but after all her mama will have been dearer than all the fine things As a Child of God feels all the outward injoyments and joys are but little compared to the Gift of God in His beloved son which He gave for us, that is that precious gift unspeakable present which we have recieved and the more we know it meditate upon it. the more we value it, the more we are able to praise God and live to Him. All the other Gifts of God in His service are to be considered as little in comparaison of the beloved only Son who has reconsiled and redeemed us. O for more knowlege of Him, for a loving* faith in Him which makes us constantly to drow out of His fulness grace for grace, this alone can suffice us, possesse many gifts and fine qualites without abiding in Him who has said in me ye shall bear much fruit, would be but a poor life, So what I wish for you and myself in this new year is such an abiding in Jesus that He may work in us through us fruits to the praise of the father, Yea dear Herman that you may be a smell of life for many in the congregation and else where.

To my dearest Tine and her three children I wish a happy and blessed year; increase of faith and childlike confidence in our Lord. I hope the next letter will give us better news of your finger, With a tender kiss and best wishes from Uranie and myself
 Yours affectly JG.
