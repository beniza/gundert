My dear wife

We were glad to hear from John and today from yourself how all has passed off and only hope that dear Ur does not feel too much the hurry and confusion of the journey and the height of the staircase. Here we have a visit from Pastor Wurm, whose daughter married Fred. Müller. Jettle gives them wine cherries etc But my heart revolts a little against the idea of many visitors coming in like manner. The afternoon I shall go with Widmann to Stammheim as Berner is to be dismissed with a blessing and some douceur. John works diligently and has not felt his trip as a burthen, was rather glad to be useful in any way. In the evening we sat in the garden with Sophie <Dorsch>*, whose birthday it was. She had kept the secret it seems from you, before you left; got many letters from sisters and brother. No other news as far as I can learn. Dr. Schönleber will not give too much medecine to Uranie I hope. The Carlsbad salts are good enough. 
My best love to George and thanks for the letter. Fred. seems I fancy resolved to try the new Colporteur. May he turn out useful! Much love to Grandmama and all the others Emma Anna etc. I hope you get there news of all quarters, perhaps also of Elisabeth at her watering place. Goodbye!  Yours HG.
