Dear Jettle

Yesterday as I related Mama about Christine two persons were near who said she might go to the institut of the invalide in Fehlbach those who have property pay 600 gulden; but one takes also those who have very little for 150 Marc As I do not know anything about it I tell it you as you surly know all about it

Yesterday evening came the Groselles; Many thanks for the troubel; but they are sour as if they had fermented in the way. however the children can eat them and are very glad

The time appears to me so short till we come to Calw that it scarsly worthwile to send a letter more from here, Wednesday DV at 10 O'C we shall be with you and so dine again together. After all you have not seen much of Dr Nast.

So this evening are to come the Misses it is perhaps better that a gentleman come with, than if it were a lady who might find fault with many things and influence the children May we recieve them in Jesus Name and keep them in His Name the exercise of love and patience shall not be lost. Give please hearty love to Emma and her house, and Marie with hers and all in the house

Adieu dear Jettle, much love from Uranie
 and from yours affectly JG.
