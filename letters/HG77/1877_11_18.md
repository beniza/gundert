1My dear Children [Hermann]

Today we had nothing from you; but it may still come tomorrow <(ja 220)>*. Till now it is not cold, in the villages peopel are in want of water, they get it per ration, that is one baquet ful daily. Emil Deckinger the brother of your George drank tea with us yesterday, he is in the civil shall become Judge, he does not seem to know much of God, while his brother Nathanaâ€°l the minister is liked by the congregation, the death of the father has brought him perhaps nearer to Christ, but in the family there is not a longing after Jesus, David is with us a fourtnight longer than he shall go to Stutgart where he has a place in Hochstrase to sell or have his depot, he did help his brother who has much to do; they differe much in carracter Frederic is easily cast down and discoraged; while David knows little of this and cannot feel with Frederic. They take much pain to bring the business of the Verein forward and have now and than pretty much trouble, May our good Lord give His blessing that it not be in vain all the troubel. We hope that you are all well and have joy and peace yea the peace which passes all understanding that it may keep your hearts and minds in Jesus, If I have it I am contented

Adieu my very dear one, Mama papa Children
