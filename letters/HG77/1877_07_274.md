Madame Emma Gundert

 27 Juillet <1877>*
My dear Emma

I have just recieved the box of goodle with your kind letter for which many thanks Uranie is quite distressed that you have taken the troubel to make her sweet bread. We are much pleased to hear that dear Elisele is so brave and good, leaving her mama so much rest at night.

Today Julia cannot go in the garden, for it rains, at least here. 
We had much joy to see dear Marie and Frederic last Sunday I wonder whether Frederic is still joyful after the meeting, did Mr MÃ¶gling come as expected I shall soon here all, I dreamed that we had to live in a very old house falling to ruin, that would not be much matter for me if God would have it 
Please give my love to all in your house, and accept from Uranie and myself hearty love and thanks
 Yours JG.
