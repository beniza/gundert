My dear wife

We have thought again about the matter of Uranie's money and think that there is no need of any thing being mentioned except what she has placed in German funds through Fred.

Yesterday I was at Hirsau, where Jettle accompanied me with Fred. Marie is well, though not yet quite able to write. John has been at Stammh. to preach and Sophie went along.

Fred goes on pretty well, the children all quite swimmingly. I send but love to Uranie and also her paper which arrived yesterday. We are thinking of an excursion to Liebenzell where Pf Schott is as also Prof. Fischer. The former came here this morning and thinks that Ammann has not been received in the new class of Missionary students.

Christine continues to cook well, yesterday a new cherry cake! 
May God keep you cheerful under all changes of weather and circumstances, and may dear Uranie derive a real benefit from the baths, is the hearty wish of
 Your HG

1Grüss Gott.
Here stamps enough.
