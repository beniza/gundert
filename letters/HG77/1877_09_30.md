Dear Children

Again good news of you all, by this time you are entering your new house; may the Lord go in with you and be the first and last; may His presence be continually felt by you all, and may He make you to be a blessing for many. 
That which you say about prayer has interested me much; how difficult to pray that is, to keep up in prayer. And it is said we should pray instantly be watchful unto prayer, besides ourselves there are so many for which we should pray; it is true the heart is decietful, how many excuses to hinder prayer till at last it becomes as a duty and even a burden to pray, If the Lord were not of long suffring and great patience what would we be? Yea it is grace nothing, but grace, even to be reminded of prayer,

The cold has already began with us, the winter is dreaded, but also for this we must pray. He can keep in good spirit and drive away all heaviness and melancoly which weak nerves provoc* by the cold.

With kind love and kisses to each of you also from Uranie
 Yours affect JG.

How glad the Children will be to enter the new house with new furnitures Emma even will observe it We rejoice for you you have had long patience
