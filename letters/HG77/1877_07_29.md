My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your kind letter which has been sent here If you cannot go in house for which you had so much troubel and Mama with the children looked forward with joy it will be a desapointment; but every thing become possible and easy with the Lord, the more we long after our home prepared by our Lord for us, Mama and the children will also get happy where God shall place them and we ourselves too if we had to mouve, the more we look above where our treasure is the less we care for the comforts of the present, if only we glorifie our Lord by our walk and words, papa will have much to tell you, of all the events in our house. We shall leave this D.V. next wednesday first August Uranie is pretty well and myself too, We had a good deal of rain during our stay here; but a nice room and all very comfortable, out of the town quiet, with a good air, however we see with pleasure the term of our absence so near.

Dear Tine will also have finished her bath I wish her much good by them. and a joyful heart with thanks for the Goodness of our Lord. And your dear three children, much love from Uranie and myself to them and Mama as well as to you dear Son
 Yours JG.

You are not loved less than formerly no surly we take it as from our father it is all right His will be done
