 31 first Dece <57>*

Dear papa

I had no idia of writing this evening but as this came with the commission of Mrs Holloway I will just sai good evening for it is already near 9 O.c. we had prayer in Chapel after tea for the last day of the year! Perhaps when this comes to you dear Marie will be with you if so I send her a kiss I can scarcly imagine that she is so near.

I have merely opened the letter of Mr Johson to put this in Fritz gave it me. He will have to go to Tellicherry about the conference regarding the Catechist institution he will telegraph to Hebich to come there to instead of going to Mang; the Inspector is very angry because of the institution at Telli it must be at Mang.

Perhaps you have letters from our boys and know about Samuel whether he is to go soon in the Mission house. Richter I have not heard today how he is I would have gone there but Mrs Holloway came

With love
 Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
