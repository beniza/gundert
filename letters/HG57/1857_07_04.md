My dear wife

It is Saturday - no letter as yet from Mang, so I suppose all is right. Yesterday evening I was at dinner with Molle's and today tuned their piano. The school is now all inspected. I have received visits from the Trustees and others and am glad to find that they do their best to have the school made effective - Tell Pfl. I paid the 6 Rs etc to the workman that repaired the Verandah (or fore-roof) of the Missionhouse. But the 35 Rs not being paid here, he will have to send them to him. I also paid Cajetan, the servant 2 1/2 Rs for 1/2 May, since he gets nothing from any body. Pochin keeps Catchery in the house, which does not contribute to its being made clean and ready for a European. I shall ask one of the teachers to superintend all the repairs necessary. We had awful rain and wind, but now it seems getting fine for my departure to morrow night.

I saw in another Overland paper, that the Seringap was 26 May at Gravesend, and had come only from Bombay (not from the Cape, which was true of another ship just before it) I have yet asked Isenberg to telegraph if he can hear anything of a death in our party. Now farewell.

The Lord be with you all. I may arrive D.V. about Tuesday afternoon if not hindered by storms
 Yours HG
