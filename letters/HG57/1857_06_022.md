+ 2 June 57.

Lieber David

I wait with writing German until I hear that you know it better than English. When you are once at Basle I will tell you what I dreamt on the 4th of May. But now I cannot speak of it. You know that Mr. Haller came yesterday (1st June) from the North. ...1 He sends plenty love to you. 
Ebenezer writs now with Mr Pfleiderer, he copies letters and makes accounts, and has got a gentlemens topi. (You know topi? _____ something like this) ...1

I wish I could now cut and saw trees with you: but you are better where you are and may the dear Lord bless you.
 Your Papa.
