Mutter an Paul

My sweet dear Paul,

this time I write to you and thank you for your last; though you wrote almost nothing; but the names of your school fellows. Your next I trust will be better; perhaps you were afraid to repeat again what your brothers had written already! You did not say, whether you like David. I am glad to hear that he likes German so much, and can already speak a little. he will soon like to learn too I hope. - You have had plenty time to play during the visit of your brothers! Hermann is still writing to us, of what has passed while he was at Bale!

It will be a very great yoy to us to get your portrait the six to gether; as for Davids one here such as I have sent one to you, I do not look at, as yet I cannot; it is in my almira .... indisch Nachrichten .... 
Tell dear Frederic that I am very glad to hear he is obedient to his aunts and loves dear Miss Culmann so much, as never go to school with out a kiss from her. I hope my David will also become obedient and affectionate, for he likes to be loved: Mr Haller takes tea with us always two or three times a week and we speak plenty of David; Lydia loves him also and get flowers from him. We have two beautiful Calves <one of the Arabichi (Vat.s Bemerkg)> and plenty milk and cheese. Now I send a tender kiss to each of you.

 with plenty love
 Your mama Julie Gundert
