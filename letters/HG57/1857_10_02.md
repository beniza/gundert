Dear Papa

Yesterday I wrote; and to day I think this may still find you at Ancola so I will tell you our news. From Mr Fritz a nice letter no furnitures are wanted except perhaps tables, lamps. I feel rather nervous at going to Calicut and all is black before me; but God s will must be first and done! 
Mr Mcgrigor did not come to the meeting; but Gompertz is pleased with him he seams to be in earnest, it was rather good he did not come; for it was not nice. Hoch was filled of the story of the day and nothing or very little to give. It was found out by the girls that Haller is engaged to Mercia the engagement took place while her Mistriss was here, as soon as H. heard of it he run up to hear Haller who said yes I like her, nothing bad passed among them also not a kiss; letters plenty Hoch torn before him her own to him even without reading them, and told him this must all go before the Comity so untill that time all must be broken, at his return down he asked of her the letters of Haller; but she went off and was brought back late at night I do not know farther, but Kaundi who spoke with finds that he loves her truly; Amongs others things he said that for some time he had a mind for Miss Will; but once in going to Bolma as he was showing her some kindness on the road she turned her shoulders to him with such a dislike that he took it for granted that she would not accept him, and Mercia being so humble and a converted girl as he thinks will do well. I told this to Missy who said I did not percieve that I was rude or proud to him in going to Bol but I felt that for some time he was kind to me; but as I thought and had heard that he was not converted I did not like to be friendly with him 
Carr's Will I have in the Almira here all is well up and down I send this in a hurry not to miss the post as H told me it must go very early 8 Oc 
 Adieu yours
