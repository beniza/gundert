My dear wife

I forgot to say that Heb's musquitoes are all gone - what a wonder! Agnes Th<omson>* bride of Dr Crocker. Yesterday morning early round Eli - evening as far as Ullala - then the Tindal was afraid and there was nothing for it but lying at anchor during the night. Slow entrance this morning - Gave your 2 letters to the lower house breakfasted with Pfl etc. visited Kindersley and Miss Chatfield. NB. Kind. wants the bull to be sent by Pattimar will keep it 1-2 months I hope you do it quickly. Not much news here. It seems Camerer is still suffering in liver. This evening meeting at Bretts'. The brethren expect the party soon from Bombay, the Parsee will do his best to send them off without loss of time. I am still a little tipsy from ship and bandy so good bye
 Yours HG
