Dr. H. Gundert, Calicut, Care of Rv M. Fritz

 Balmatta 15th Aug <57>*
Dear papa

You will be surprised to find so little news from our dear Children, but it will come by and by Frederic s one is very nice and David s number hundred years how like him! but I wonder that Marie did not send one line. I have not heard from you yesterday; but hope to get some lines to day. Here all is as usual. Sister Hoch pretty well. He is often here. The Candidat who is coming is a married man it seems so they will want room. The Dr finds Mrs Hoch less well and says that she ought to go away The friends in the upper country are anxious it seem about the state of the country!

Adieu dear papa love to all
 Yours affectly
 Julie Gundert
