 Malap. 9 Aug 57

My dear wife

This is Sunday, the last hour before I go up to the little chapel. So you will be satisfied that I tell you your letters have arrived and that I feel with you in all that is before you. I hope Mrs H. will get Mrs Degg to come down and rest with her. Perhaps she (Mrs D) might even come for her and do the work at Mang. That about Degg I had myself written to Basle. but never mind. About Camerer I could no more write. You cannot leave Mang. for such a purpose as you have little authority over bearers etc. But I think the Lord will before this have shown his will to you all. - Floyd was very nice, a Rom Cath soldier is coming very near. As for Thomas I am more and more pleased with him and fear Haultain wrongs him, for Christians may often be too imperious In what they fancy a good cause. Lieut Clemons is nice, Syme his companion wretched and yet no whit nearer to faith than he was before he began his acquaintance with these Christians, Dixon, Thomas and Clemons. Still he hears a good deal and does not oppose, only falls asleep over it. - Tomorrow Dr. Cleghorn is expected, who did Müller so much good - also Robinson is to come. Now farewell for the present. Rice here so dear that Shancara says, 4 Edangalis for 1 Rupee! But a fine harvest draws nigh rapidly

… Dieu
 Yours affly
