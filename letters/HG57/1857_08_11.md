Dear papa

As I have no time to send you this letter of Mrs Young I have but time to say that here all is as usual. Mrs Hoch is now to be for some days with out remedy if she does not get stronger she will have to go to Coimbatoor She has had a good deal of Colomel and her stools are somewhat better we must wait to see how it will be without medecine.

Yesterday and to day no letter from you, but it may still come. Your last was from Malapuram. Adieu dear papa a few days and we get home news I hope 
 yours aff J Gundert

just received yours of the 8th for which many thanks you will have received many letters by this time
