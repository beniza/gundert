<Dr H Gundert, Ancola>1

 Mangalore 1 Oct 57
Dear Papa

Yesterday at 2 after noon Mrs Hoch gave birth to a <Marieli>* nice healthy girl! Mother and child well. The Dr was astonished and thankful to see how well it went over. She cried a good deal even before the right pains came so the Dr told her to keep her strength for the right time.

I have forgotten to give you a worm blanket. please to ask one from Mr Goddard or the Lowry, you may give back at your return I am very sorry to have forgotten No letters as yet from any quarter. You are going very slowly at least here is no good wind for you. May God give you grace and incline the woman to join the mission!

Paul and March Hoch were at Balmata three little cats were born there these were more to them than the little sister, they talk of nothing but of the cats so deos Lydia. We are all well.

Now having nothing more to say I wish you peace and joy
 yours Julie Gundert
