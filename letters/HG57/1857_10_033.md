 Mangalore 3d Oct <57>*

Dear Papa

The receipt of Gresserrce* mentioned in the few words of Mr Robinson here joint I have kept here as it is on very thick paper. Namely "Received from W Robinson Esquire on account of Dr. H Gundert the sum of Rupees (10) Ten* I.R. Gresserrce*"

Yesterday I sent for Anna; <Anna ist die von Carr verfÃ¼hrte.>* but she could not come being not well. So I went to see what was the matter. she has fever not of much consequence I told her of going to Calicut; She said she would let me know next week what she will do! She said she had not gone to the mission house on account of the fever; but I do not beleive it. Mercia is to be sent to Mercara until news from the Comite come. Haller will have her if allowed by the Com. Hoch sais that he cannot stay here if she is his wife for the evil it might make among the other girls I have no news to give you, The mother of the Dobie went this morning to Cannanore; they wrote that she must go to help as they have too much work since the Chombala Muller are there. Give my love to dear Sister Mulle whom I would have liked to visit very much

With love to you and to the people there
 Yours J Gundert
