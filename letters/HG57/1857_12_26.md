My dear wife

I was glad to hear of the Telegr, after the Dr had already yesterday announced that the steamer arrived on the 21st. Evidently they must have delayed telegraphg to you because of other (Governmt's) work. - I am glad if all went off to R's satisfaction. He is very sanguine, but I hope the final decision of Mrs. S. was in keeping with the first reception for tea. Excuse me with him, please, I cannot write just now having to settle many schoolmatters. Perhaps I shall have to go to Karcal, and must delay it till Mary arrives lest I miss her the day of the landing.

The thread I gave to Pfl. The iron mortar sought, but not yet found. Must we perhaps empty the great box for it? Degg. is still angry that his wife alone has been wished for, not he - he has been very cross to her occasionally. Chatfield visited me today, very condescending. No more news.  Yours HGdt
Love to all
