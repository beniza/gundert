+ (David)

 ca. 18/19 April 1857.

I think I must fill this up for my David. Now it is exactly 3 months, that you left us - then we were with Mr. Hebich, and now he is with us here for a visit. He also thinks of David, and asks if we often remember him. That would be a strange thing if we did not remember our David. Chiefly Mama, who even now sometimes feels in the bed after you. God has been very gracious to dear Mama, and made the broken heart somewhat whole. I hope also the pieces of your little heart have been nicely joined together. God can do this work very cleverly. And it is of some profit even for a little boy to have now and then a broken heart, because God likes to come into such hearts and do wonderful business there. Hearts which are never broken won't do at all for Him. -

Bella I think still remembers you, but Lydia is very forgetfull. Yette will soon marry - Manuel the bookbinder. Ebenezer has gone to Chiracal to see your Mimi and her Samuel. Paul Hoch who has boils come sometimes up and spends a day with us.

 Farewell your
 Father
