My very sweet David

How did you sleep? Last night when I awoke, I felt about, to find my precious David, but he was not by my side as the other days; but then I looked to the dear Lord Jesus and felt sure he was also with you and all the dear people in the Cabine. I hope my precious David you are obedient and love your dear Papa and Mama Bührer who will be so kind to you and also Esther. Give to your dear Mama Buhr. a tender kiss from me ...2 I have been much with you all, I hope we shall get a letter from you, my very dear Sophie (Bührer) and from your good partner. We long to hear how you have been last night and how are the children and Esther. Have you real help in your people? is the food tolerable? They had very few provisions, but I suppose they will get at Cochin and also a cow more, for a single one as they have is far from enough for so many, besides it might get out of milk. ...2
