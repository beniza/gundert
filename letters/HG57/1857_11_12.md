My dear wife

I went with the pony till Pudiangadi - the little fellow made compliments before every big carriage I met, so that I had unwillingly to turn my back upon the ladies (Cook - Holloway) - walked the remainders, boat ready - and without _______ very smoothly to this place, which I reached about 4 AM. slept a little bit, and breakfasted - School not yet seen

My keys I sent with Changaran, the boxkey I found after all. Ram serves delightfully, cleans even shoes, an extent of devotedness which is perfectly new to me.

I thought much about Missy - and the matter appears to me probably from God - but it seems to me that a little bit of inquiry could do no harm. Perhaps Crowther if ever he comes to the house, might say what he knows of Lange, or Fritz might ask Lawson confidentially. Please ask him if he would do that. - At Cann. I must probably remain even on Tuesday, so that Monday morning - sunrise - would be the last moment for your letters. If they delay at all at Mang. the horse may even only arrive on Wednesday. 
Now love to all
 Yours HG
