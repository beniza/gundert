Dear papa

Thanks for yours of the 13th So you were to be at Calicut yesterday perhaps the letter I have sent off before I had yours will no more reach you there. I trust your having become so wet did not hurt you and that with God's grace you are well.

Camerer has come, the Moolki congregation will now be without a missionary and stand for it self some or perhaps many will return to heathnisem or become musulman. Camerer is going to Udupi to live there. Poor Hoch is still out of sort, very cross and hasty. Carr took tea here he is nice. Mrs Hoch pretty well. The price of the rice which had encreased much is decreasing since one knows the harvest has taken place down the coast Robinson who heard of it made it known; but poor people are still gathering for help. 
The friend of Carr from Honor has written him that poor Mr Molle is so fearfully frightened that it would be no wonder if he was get sick and die The Mullers at Hoobli have been requested to be ready to quit the place and take refuge in the fort of Dahrwar in case of necessity A day of fasting and prayer has been appointed by the Bishop. Perhaps the Lord will still give time to the begining churches in this country before they be tried and persecuted. The Lord be with you love to all
 Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
