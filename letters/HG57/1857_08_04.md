My dear wife

Yesterday the Fritz's were sometimes doubtful if their babe was to live: it seemed so very weak and yet now and then agitated and nearly convulsed - but now it seems all goes on better than could have been expected after the beginning. Changara arrived late Sunday evening. Yesterday I saw Robinson and heard that by a telegraphic message 30000 English troops were promised overland, so that even now probably 1000's are already in Egypt. - Kittel writes to Fr. that Degg. sees himself always surrounded by mutineers. Poor fellow, the Comm. ought to have pity on him and call him home. 
Dr Drew visited yesterday evening, Crocker will have arrived this morning in his stead. Heb wants Fritz to have some Engl service for Crocker's sake but I hardly see how that can be done. There are no Engl. Christians here desirous of hearing Fritz. Tell dear Hoch I have examined Phipps, who is well versed in English readg and writing, but hardly remembers any thing of Geography fractions etc. I do not think that after being accustomed to a salary of 20 Rs he will do for school service in Canara.

As the Drew's leave at once Haller ought to send Fritz the account for their clothes etc without delay. The Cooks have also got theirs. Perhaps Haller might charge Miss Chatfield only 1/4 Rup and Mrs Cook another 1/4 Rup.

 Now farewell
 Yours HG
