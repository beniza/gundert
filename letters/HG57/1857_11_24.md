My dear wife

Monday evening I left Tellich and came the 2 little stages to Cootuparambu (where we had been together in Jan 43) and Canote Tuesday afternoon came up the Ghaut, mostly walking, the horse being very weak, slept in Periah bangalow. The servant could get no bearers for the 2 Headloads, so took hold of 2 Chalias to come up all the way. Poor fellows, they nearly died under it! The Maplas at the foot of the Ghaut would do no Cooly work and so pointed out these 2 weak men, who perhaps had never born a load, much less ascended a Ghaut with it. This morning 17 or 16 miles, mostly walking, horse somewhat lame. I only hope it will not delay me tomorrow Your letter of the 17th I met here in it the first news of any Mercur's Surely you might have sent these to Telly as well as the letters 20 Tolas weight for 1 Anna - But now keep them. For the writer I send work thro' Aldinger. - They are at last doing something for the Rom. Cath School at Mangalore but nothing as yet for Hoch's, beyond the old support. I am not pleased with my school here the master is evidently careless - and as I hear from the officer (Capt Cunningham with whom I live in the bangalow) acts as writer to this Captain in his leisure hours. So he makes money, but does not improve 
No Ramen as yet, nor Coolies - it is past noon!
 Farewell
 Your HG.
