Rev H. Gundert, Mangalore1

 Tell. 21 Nov 57
My dear wife

No horse nor notice about it. I will now try to obtain a Manjil from Brennen or where, and get bearers. Fritz is lying on the couch somewhat tired from having taken one of his blue pills This morning I expect Mr Convert will have arrived and told you of our news. Young Harley passed thro' this morning, I have hardly seen him. The news about Mrs Holloway is still distressing. The Chatfields have gone to Mangalore. You say nothing about the letters, if you read them or had them read to you I trust that Mary has set out in spite of the protestation from Stuttgardt. Pfleid's bride may come out at the same time, if his father has found one for him. Mögl, I hear is not accepted by the Church Mission. Kaund. likes Mang. again doubly after his return from Coorg.

Bührer's letter very empty - Mrs Bühler is reported by Mrs Müller to be truly fine and growing. Of the money I do not know - did Thomas send the 391 - but never mind I shall see when I return. How are you with regard to the people? I should like to be soon down again from the Wynaud, otherwise I can hardly visit Ponany and Malapuram before I shall have to go off for Manantoddy. Fritz will on Monday go off to Cann. for his business there - hard work I fear. Now farewell, the Lord with you and
 Yours HG.

The old horsekeeper wants again to serve and would even return to Mangalore it seems, Changara becomes perhaps Mrs Müller's servant.
