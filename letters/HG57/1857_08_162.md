 Calicut 16 Aug <57>*

My dear wife

This morning - again a Sunday - I am just arrived here, waiting for letters, but nothing will come. I left Ponany yesterday afternoon first per boat, and then from Tanore with bearers, rather troublesome, though but little rain. Here I feel again among gentlemen, for to say the truth, it was some hardship to live in that stable, the goats now eating away at my Manjil cover, and then dirtying all about my writingplace: the washerman hanging Mrs K's things on both sides of where I sat, and Kilroy walking up and down with me chewing tobacco and squirting it to the right and left. But they were kind enough and felt of course not what was the difficulty with me. Perhaps I have also become more difficult than I was formerly. We have such a tendency upwards. Still I think many people might be poorer and yet have things in a neater way. - Here I learn that Fritz's child is pretty well, but Mrs. was very weak a few days back. Him I have not seen only the younger brethren who tell me that on the 25th there will be a Distr Conference at Calicut, about the changes in Cannanore. I hope then to be at Cannanore, if not already on my way to Mangalore. The Lord be with you all  Yours HG.

Just now Fritz came and said the post has sent my letters to Cannanore!!!
