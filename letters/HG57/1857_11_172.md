My dear wife

Today your letter, best thanks, you see from Pauline's that Kaund stayed again longer than agreed at Mercara - so I won't wait longer for the horse. You may still answer perhaps to me at Tellichy. For I will go today to Taliparambu and early on Thursday to Tellichy and then only to the Wynaud. - I send the shoes (yours at 10 As - mine at 1 1/2 Rs) in Convert's bedparcel -

I never heard of Fritz's idea to go Chomb. rather of a liking to go home and retire - but God knows that.

Brigr still ill - goes to Mercara. Crocker follows probably I hear nothing of a marriage

The brethren got a Pattimar to Mangalore and Coompta or Tadry. I shall now go with Sauvain to Cherical The people are very nice. Now farewell - I shall be glad to return already 8 days away and hardly anything done. - I think you might strongly recommend the elder Schmidt to Mrs Weigle for Richter

Now plenty Selams to Ald, Laufr etc (who is Albert did you write it for Aldinger?)
 Yours HG

Convert left yesterday with MÃ¼ll for Chombala from whence he will push on
