If he has left to be burnt and not sent after him

 <18 Nov>1 <57>*

Dear Papa

As I did not know that you would go through Tellicherry, I have sent off yesterday a letter to Manontoddy. I trust the letters of our children will reach you at Tell since you say I may answer yours of the 17th I venjure to send you all I have no news, except that Harly came to day to meet his brother whom you saw. I have advised him to go to see Mr Hebich and hear from him how he may be converted, he then said he would go to Reihnious <Rhenius>* and escape H. We then tried Aldinger and I to speak to him; but he tooks set on the world;

The two Schmidts came for dinnar with him, I told them that I would like their sisters to spend a day with me and the Mama too, I have promised P. to try to see a little of them. I shall let her know what you say on the subject. A letter from Mrs Leslie asking table clothes etc. I have sent her order to Mangalore

When do think of coming back? Schmidt said that he had heard of Mrs Holloway having had a fall fom a window 12 feet high, but he knew nothing more nor have I heard any thing more. I see no one nor hear from any one Thomas is not here nor Robinson Aldinger could not get the Money; but I have enough with out it. Now Adieu
 Yours afftly
 J Gundert
