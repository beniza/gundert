Dear papa

Thanks for yours from Tellichery On Sunday no Gentleman came to the Lord supper. It had not been told thats to say Carr heard it accidentely! Yesterday the misseonary meeting all the people were; but Carr and Gompertz did not take tea; as it was half past 8 as it ended. I took tea down for Missy sake as I thought she would feel very shy.

Mrs Hoch is still very much the same, The Dr thinks that the other coast would help; but it cannot be done! We have now fine weather, last sunday was a Musulmans feast the other one of 11 days is near. God will keep us, at Hoobly a Delhiman was caught who had come to the prist, they have no rain in the upper country they fear a famine. Just now got yours of Calicut for which thanks.

Kauntinga just gone to Bolma. Here all is as usual To morrow a week since you left 3 more and you be back D.V. Yesterday Hoch said now we are in fear for our brethren who are coming out they will find no room in ships or steamers, because of the armies who are coming; but now they are in the way already!

 Love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
