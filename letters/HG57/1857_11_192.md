My dear wife

This morning 1 AM I arrived by boat from Cann. Now I have seen the school and Brennen (the latter better in health) Sharpe the Magistrate would not see me as I came during breakfast time.

Convert will leave tomorrow I think early, and he may reach Cal. easily within 24 hours, - Of the pony no notice at all, so I cannot push on as I would - Convert knows Dothaux as juge de paix at Corcelles. Otherwise he is unacquainted with our families. With difficulty something about the children to be got from him - Chatfield I met at Cann. he goes now to Mang. Frere is expected back here Fritz pretty well and cheerful Paul at Talip very soft since the loss of his wife - I think CM has declared openly that he cannot live at Cann. as was the case hitherto, Heb. not giving him any spiritual work. Fr. will have rather hard work there when he goes over. Diez has been quite frightened when he saw M. would gladly return to Chomb. and begged only by no means to send him back to Cannanore. So you see there are every where difficult points moved and it is only the Lord that can bring us through all without misery and a complete break down. Committing you to him I remain
 Yours HG
