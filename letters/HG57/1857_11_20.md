My dear wife

Got the letters just as I was writing home. You received them it seems at the same time. You say nothing of the 1st money I sent to Thomas (391) Did he send that? Why can Ald. not send the other to Mr Bates to settle for him? Strange you never knew to write Rhenius? Have you read the children's letters? Nearly too much for a slow translator like Ald. I am annoyed with this horsebusiness. No word at all about it. perhaps after all I must return to Cal without seeing Manant. - Convert left this morning by bandy intending from Chomb to take a boat. Now farewell grace be with you - (write also dates in your letters)
 Yours affly HG
