Dear papa

Thanks for yours of Malapuram Though I have no news I write a few words in sending you this of Pl. The conditions of Deggeler surprised me; poor man that he cannot learn to humble himself. There came also a long letter from Major Carr which you shall find here. I do not write much I must spare my eye which has been wonderfully preserved yesterday. Lydia had a stick in hand as it was rather dark and as I stooped down it entered my left eye I might have been very much hurt; but by Gods grace this morning to my surprise I am able to open it and feel quite well. I kept cold water on it during the night. Of how many tender mercies am I the object. May I also have more faith for me and other and exercise that faith in praying more. 
 With love Yours affectly
 Julie Gundert
