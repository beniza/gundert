My dear wife

Still no horse - today also no letter from you. As for the crochet hooks, Mrs M thinks that George makes them bad and very dear, wherefore I have written to Mrs Irion and begged her to have the Dozen made. Mrs M had them repeatedly made at Tellich to her satisfaction. - I also sent to Mrs Irion the thread - As for Mrs M and Diez's thread they will settle among themselves how much is to go to Chombala. - Convert brings your part, also all the needles, and the music for me. Ernst's photograph is also in it. No notice as yet of our boys' picture. - Pfl it seems has got permission to marry. About Haller the news are contradictory. None knows what will be the end. - Convert will put the clock aright. He is nice and I like him. - Of Mr Lange I think very little, Heb. tries his best with him, but I think he will after all escape and leave the Coast without much more than a general impression in favor of religion.

Brigr still sick. - Hault. does not care about Thomas wants only to have to do with real Christians and no halfcaste of any sort. I say it is wrong if we Miss[ionar]ies give any way into this feeling, because we have all sorts of halfcastes and nocastes at all within the mission. I shall be glad to hear a word of Thomas, whom I begged to send you (for Fritz) the 391- Rs from Govt.

 Yours affly
 H Gundert
