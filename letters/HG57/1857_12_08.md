 Malapuram 8 Dec <57>*
My dear wife

Yesterday about 5 PM arrived about halfway at a Bazar (Cadungonteru or what ever the name was) and there found Rama horsekeeper and Coolies - arrived certainly an hour or 2 before them at Condoty, and should have had to wait long if Mr (or Capt. <Engineers>*) Bean had not been there who gave me tea (with a drop of milk) Long talk with him - then ate your pudding and went to bed, but not much to sleep. In the morning 4 - 8 1/2 A.M. rode with Bean <Engin. Capt.>* to this, breakfasted with him, visited School, and live at Thomas'. B. is an interesting man, rather low church, seeking the truth, fond of <chaplain>* Rhenius' preaching, tho' not of his ways, and abhorring Mr Lutyen's teaching. I think he has heard much against Heb. chiefly want of charity etc, I would rather admit now and then want of discretion or wisdom, than want of real love and patience. He was glad to see we liked his wife: appears to have indifferent health and cannot trust his liver into the sun. Ramotti and Coolies arrived only about 11 A.M. - slow travelling this, so I shall try to fill my pockets before starting next. My little Mspt map I left after all in the decentcoat I put on for the visits of the forenoon. Hoogewerf the schoolmaster has for many months his brother with him, who should like I think to get a similar place. At noon had coffee and cheese and D.V. shall dine with Bean at 7 P.M. Grace be with you and
 your HG.
