Mrs Gundert, Mangalore

 Cochin 8 May 57
My dear wife

I have not done so much today as yesterday because I was tired. Saw the girlschool, rather a tame affair after the boys. The mistress may be something in her way, but it is difficult for me to get a word out of her and many of the girls are inveterate gigglers, so that you must always be on your guard and even then you may unawares provoke them to laughter. The first class however are truly nice children - 3 in number. - I could not catch their attention as with the boys. To these I was glad to preach a little in catechizing them. - I visited the family mentioned by dear Carr and spoke as long as I had breath, about the one thing needful. Very attentive, but I fear mere politeness. - Heard from Calicut and that Moer has a son. Nothing as yet from Mangalore. Mrs Cullin remembers you still from 1847 or 8. I thought of our Mary when I saw her rejoicing over a daughter returned from one year's trip. - Now fare well - love to all, - tell Pfl. the parcel has gone to Capt. Shawe. Love to Kaundinya and the remaining boys when they return from Coorg
 Yours HG

This is the last from here the next may be delayed
