My dear wife

Yesterday I got your letters with others at Chomb. whither I had begged Heb to send them. I enclose one from there. I have just sent off yours to Mrs Yg uncertain if it is in time. You ought to write direct in such cases, where there is risk of losing time.

Thank Hoch and Pfl for their letters, I cannot answer them, as there is rather too much work to fill the few days at Cann. - Tell them the Swabian Mercury has been sent to me direct from Madr I have just finished lookg through it (in Manjil from Chombala)

Here all well. At Chomb. preparations for going. Heb. had been over, the work gave no difficulty, but cooking etc questions. Heb offered at once to dine with Madam in their house.

The Diez's are yet to be 14 days with CM's at Chomb. to learn all about the station. I saw all the women from our institution Plenty Selams to you. Luke's wife looks very resigned Aline stronger Phoebe taller. Farewell  the Lord with you and HG
