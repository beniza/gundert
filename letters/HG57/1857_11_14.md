 Cann 14 Nov <57>*
My dear wife

I got yours this morning after Heb. and brethren had gone to Chovva. - You tell me not to bother myself with the box, your letter however is so full of it to the exclusion of every thing else that I suppose you find it quite a treasure. I have sent for it to the Customhouse after much search, and hope they will give it out. Then I shall do my best to separate, but have no doubt I shall make mistakes.

The Müller's want, it seems, to go into the Compd of the Engl School and have done with Heb's vicinity. M probably goes with Convert to Chomb to meet Fr. there

I saw the Brigr this morning. Fancy the first royals that had come to Cann. and were sent off to Masulipatam, were detained at Galle, and sent back to this place - arrived yesterday - and after telegraphg to Madras they are now to be sent back to Masulip. Crocker pretty well, perhaps goes home. - Mrs West and Stevens visited Mrs Müller, I did not see them. - Dear Youngs arrived safely in Engld. Mrs Cummin writes cheerfully, sends also a Selam to us and asks for letters from us or Mglgs - Dobbie returned from Birmah to the hills, where his wife expects confinemt. <The Revd S. Hebich>1 got this letter from dear Gompertz, but before we passed <Cannanore>1. - The mail is in perhaps you have already letters. You may if you get this on Monday morning still answer it, if only in the course of Tuesday, I think it will be too late.

Now farewell
 Yours HGdt

The brethren look truly nice
