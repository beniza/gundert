My dear wife

Yesterday evening I arrived here. Mrs. Irion will not send the table cloths now, and therefore no account ought to be sent at present. If Miss Chatfield returns the one after trying the best to mend it. Mr Haller will have to order what to do with it.

We have better weather this morning. I hope to leave at once and reach Calicut at night. We are thinking of printing schoolbooks here, as the Cottayam people are for a long time without paper and materials. Love to all  Yours HGdt
