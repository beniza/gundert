My dear wife

It is Thursday afternoon, and you will probably again assemble for reading. I wonder Rom XII was not read a second time and considered, seeing that so few verses had been meditated upon. - I got your letter yesterday evening, when I had much to do visiting the Provincl School and talking with the Masters - afterwards dining with Robinson and Thompson the school master after which I went off in the Manjil. Got a loaf with me which the Mucwas of Calicut stole from me, so I had time to digest Rob's dinner till 11 A.M when I arrived at Thoma's place. He had waited for me with the breakfast, after which I went to the School, he to the Catchery. I found the school better than I expected but an omnium gatherum of all castes The schoolmaster a nice little fellow more pleasing than the 3-4 candidates whom I had examined at Calicut. Th. very nice as far as it goes - but not reconciled to Haultain: we shall probably soon have a talk about it. He thinks very highly of our Mrs. Th. (at Mang) -

Please tell Pfleid that the books may be sent to Manjanathiyam at once. He is safe. As for Camerer I could no more write with this mail. Yesterday my letters to Basle and Stuttg have gone off, but I hope not to forget the subject next time please tell Pfl. Thank HK for his additions. Poor Dr I wish he could believe more cheerfully But here is the fault of us all - heaven open and we make compliments at the gate. May we enter  Yours HG
