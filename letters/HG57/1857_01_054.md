 5th Jan. 1857

My dear Paul.

I am very glad that I can write a letter to you. I hope you will be able to understand it. This evening we are going in a Pattimar to Cannanore, and a few days after the ship will go, which takes David and also this letter along. On the 29th of this month you will be seven years old. I hope my Paul is improving in learning, and reading many nice story books, I am glad, that you have a little garden, and so many flowers, in it, David is also very fond of gardening. I would have liked to send something to you, of this country; but there is nothing small to be got. I will send you a flower from the "Cape, of Good Hope." Now dear Paul, I must say Adieu, May the Lord bless you and make you to grow in His love and fear. Ruth also sends you salaams.
 With love and kisses, yours
 Margaret Will
