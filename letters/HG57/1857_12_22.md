 Cannanore 22 Dec <57>*
 7-8 PM

My dear wife

You will have heard that there was some delay with our departure. A longer delay followed on board the Pattimar or banderboat (very comfortable though). At last I should think about 2 AM we sailed - About sunrise were near Trikodi that point North of Coilandy pointed out to you - Thence by hard sailing and repeated talking as far as Cannanore, where at last we entered rowing 7 PM I landed - heard Heb for 1/4 hour preaching about Mtth 1,2 (I should think - sons of Jacob) and then bethought myself of writing to you a line. I wonder if you gave to the Calic boatwallahs more than the 1/4 Rup they refused out of my hand. I also hear just now that Richter has passed through and may now land at Calicut. May the Lord direct you in all this matter. Perhaps he takes Miss Hall instead, who knows!

Had no cooking except some coffeemaking, for which the milk was yet good. The dog refused all but my cheese and herring - thinking of the fleshpots of Calicut I suppose - From cards on Heb's table I suppose that all the officers of HM 66 have paid him a visit

Now farewell - love to all, esp the little brats
 Your HG
