Dear papa

By Convert I heard that you were delaied and troubled with the boat, I am sorry for it I should have thought about it. I also forgot to give you slippers and braces!

To day came these two notes, just as we had finished dinner came Capt Robinson with family on their way to Cannanore. He is indeed nice the love of a newborn in burning in him; his wife talks very little rather simple. Obrien had come a few hours before them, they are all going by sea this evening to Can. he speaks Rob of his two eldest girls as being the Lords, and also all his servants in this he is perhaps too hasty. however he is nice and has much fire what is mixture still, the Lord whom he is will clean all that

You see poor Ri. how desapointed he will be, he may come in this night. Now with love to all specially to the Dr and the brethren
 Yours J. Gundert

Joseph was also with Obrion.
