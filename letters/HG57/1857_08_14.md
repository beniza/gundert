My dear wife

I hope to leave this tomorrow. Today I spent my 6 hours at the school. The Brahman who keeps it was considerably electrified when I told him of the pay he would receive: "too less" was the word. Poor fellows, they thought our Dept would prove a real goldmine, and now it looks as if we only wanted to starve people to death. I hope however they will not run away at once, but stay and clamour for increase, and if they deserve it I hope to do my best for them. I wonder now in looking back how we got Catechists at all with the 5-6 Rs we formerly gave them. Dixon pays one of Fritz's Christians 35 Rs for work on the Railroad. - I don't know how it is, handkerchiefs and neckcloths diminish considerably on such a journey. A loss of 100 pct and of 50 pct has been ascertained in this respect. I fear as people have it, I am really too good for this wicked world. You see I am tired or I should not write such nonsense: but the paper is also so bad, it deserves not to be better scribbled over. Anyhow you know that I am still alive, and that you may soon get a letter from Calicut. Betsy can just spell - is very slow - likes my gingerbreads, so does the baby of 2 years. They treat me very kindly but I lodge with goats and 1 cow in the lower story: I was invited upstairs, where however the family as it is finds hardly place enough.
