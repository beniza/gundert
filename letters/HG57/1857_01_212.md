My very dear sons

I have but little time just now therefore will write but little this time. The dear David has left us on the 18th inst. poor thing he was rather moved and asked weeping "why can I not stay a year longer or why d'ont you come along"? One day he said as I was walking with him "It often comes in my mind especially when I think of the ship why was I not born with a tape binding me to you so that we can not be separated" You see the dear boy has many a why and why. You will have many such why to answer when he comes to you! I know and am sure that you will be very kind to him d'ont you? he is very affectionate to those who show him love!

I was much pleased to hear that my dear Paul is now truly diligent and learns well and that you both are good children and obedient David can tell you how useful is the pretty bag or sack you have made for us. I would have liked to send you some little presents by your brother but having nothing useful We have sent some money to Dear Miss Culman who shall buy for you what she thinks good for each of you. What a joyful meeting you are going to have when Herman, Samuel, Marie shall come to BÆ’le to see you after the arrival of David

Now sweet boys I send you a tender kiss
 Your affectionate Mama
