 Cal 5 Aug <57>*

My dear wife

I intend to dine this evening with Robinsons where the Engl Schoolmaster Mr Thompson will also make his appearance, and then in Manjil to Malapuram. Rob. is very kind and feels I think that these are times of great responsibility, not merely for officers of Govt but for those that profess faith in Christ. If you write letters after receipt of this address to Calicut. Not many however, for I hope soon to leave for the North, probably Badagherry where a school may be established before I leave Malabar. I suppose you have got the Germ. papers and Mr Pfleid will have sent them to Malap or Ponany which is right.

Mrs Fr. and baby getting on well. Yesterday came Dr Cocker with whom we were much pleased. He seems to be very hearty and resolute.

Now farewell for a time that is one or 2 days, from Malap I write D.V. again. Today I will try to get up an overland letter.

 Yours affly
 HGdt

Love to all the brethren, I hope Sister H. is better
