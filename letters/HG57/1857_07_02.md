My dear wife

Just arrived at Honore. Perhaps Camerer wrote that on Wednesday morning I spent some hours with him. The Mang. bearers took me off about 10 1/2 PM and the ferry people let me wait 3/4 of an hour. They have probably not yet heard that Dehli is taken, so I kept my peace (and my pice too). Talked with the Oodapi Tahsildar an hour or so. Was there again delayed. Afterwards all went well only one hour after leaving Byndoor the moon went down and the bearers had no leaf torches - so they forced me to stay near a shop some 4 hours. These were the worst bearers I had and they spoke good Canarese. When I came down the last steep hill from Mankay and saw Honore and the river before it in all its glory, Changara came out of a shop and offered an Elanir. This was the first water since Oodapie, exceptg what I drank from the brook by the way. So it was very grateful. Together we passed the river - under the last of the few light showers we had - and strong winds we had - and entered together into the Travellers' bangalow. The remembrances of Nov 1846 came up again but I have not yet seen the Missionhouse.

Now farewell and may the Lord be with us these few days of separation we have before us.

Love to HK Plebst Pfl and the brethren above and below
 Yours HG
