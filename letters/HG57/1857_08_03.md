My dear wife

Yesterday evening your letter came with Herm's. best thanks. But weigh your letters! Your heavy envelope cost me 2 As. - About 9 PM Sister Fritz gave birth to twins. The taller boy was dead, the girl is alive but apparently feeble. Mrs F. pretty well for her circumstances. She had not been in her usual health for some time.

It is now nearly sure that Diez will go to Chomb and CM to Cann. The Comm. will have him to look after the Anj people

No news here about BÃ¼hr's etc, what Herm writes is very nice. I think he will have done them good at the Kinderhaus and in future I will see that the boys pay visits to Stuttg in the Vacations.

Titus wrote to Mgl that Insp is ordered by the Drs to give up his work but the Comm will not let him go. His letter to me is very nice and grants you your wish. So that on this score you cannot desire any more. 
Now farewell
 Yours HG
