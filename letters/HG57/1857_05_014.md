My sweet dear sons <Fr and Paul>*

Many thanks to my precious David for his nice letter written at the Cape. It was a very great joy for us to see your writing. You did not like the ship's life. But now you like Bale very much dont you? Learning, playing, such a busy life is it not nice? and God has given you such a good Mama in Miss Culman and Miss Burk. And your dear brothers how kind they are to you I trust you love each other very much and help each other joyfully? You ask after your Dogs they are all well and also Mr Haller's cats: often I would beat them out of the house, for they are terrible thieves, but for your sake I bear with them. Do you remember how you took the stick once against Mr Kaundingna who wanted to beat the cat?

Ebenezer is now with Mr Pfleiderer Since Herman and Zacharias have died there are no more Catechists boys here. William has gone to Tellicherry, Joseph to Cannanore, Samuel to Mercara, Lot is in the boy's school under Mr Pfleiderer. Lydia is again well she was much interested to hear your letter and often repeats its contents. Miss Will is well Mrs Hoch not well, her boys well only boils. I send plenty kisses to you three My sweet Frederic must take good courage, by and by it will not be so hard to learn. With plenty love
 Your Mama Julie Gundert
