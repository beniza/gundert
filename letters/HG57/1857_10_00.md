Dear papa

As this has just come I send it with the Mercure which have just arrived; that is they are to go to Ponany. Mr Fritz is coming on Monday Sunday he is to be at Coilandi; He had fever but is better.

Yesterday evening came to tea the eldest son Schmid with two sisters; He said that next week <(4 Nov)>* the examination at school is to take place and you are expected for the Malayalim, it is a good thing you have not to go to Mangalore so soon. Aldinger asked me whether the young lady takes any interest at school or in the mission work. All here is as usual no news to my knowlege Convert pretty well Aldinger always happy he is a fine soul, faithful in the work, if Convert is as fine as he by and by we may be satisfied.

Having nothing to say but good wishes that peace and joy may abide with you in all humility

 Yours affectly
 J Gundert
