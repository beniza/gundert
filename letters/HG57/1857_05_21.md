My dear wife

On Tuesday evening I dined with Robinson, was rather pleased with the Lady, but not so much with him, for I fear there is at present little spiritual desire about him. Yesterday morning to Ellatur in Fritz's bandy and by boat to Vadagara. Arrived late about 6 1/2 PM and bearers tho' posted drank still Canjii, but I would not wait as the evening looked pretty dry after a good deal of rain, and walked to Chombal... very dark - when I arrived before the* Compd the darkness was so great that I could not find the entrance; searched long with my stick - and storm and rain pouring went often into the ditch - at last the gate became visible - a little lamp in the kitchen helped me to go so far, and a servant led me by the hand into the dwelling house. 8 1/2 PM nice evening. In the morning found that bearers had brought the Manjil about midnight. Arrived here during service the bearers knew it was a ____________________. They had in the storm exclaimed ___________________ and ___________________________________, and when I wanted an explanation, said ____________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________ - Degg's are here detained by the rain - Irion's well Lenele nice - Plenty Selams to All. The Lord be with you
 Yours HG.
