 Mang 15 Jun. 57
My dear Dav

Yesterday we have heard that we must wait a fortnight longer before we can hear from you and we are naturally wery full of expectation now. I have written to Bombay that they must telegraph to me your arrival. Today I have heard a sad news, but also a good news, and this is that our dear Major Boswell has died of Cholera. - He loved you very much and often imitated you saying in your style: Let I tell -

But he has chiefly loved well the Lord Jesus, because he takes all our sins from us. Oh what a happy thing, when one dies so quickly as also our dear Zachariah and Hermann have died, to know that all is right and that angels will take care of us and transport us to the right place. That goes much quicker and nicer than any ship or steamer. Can you still read English? Your Mimi <Elis. Blandford> writes full of joy, that the Lord has restored her dear husband Mr Diez, who has been sick unto death. But now he is recovering <(bei Maj Young)>. Praised be the Lord. We shall be with you in spirit on the 1st and 2d July <(da Herm. und Sam und Marie auch in Basel -)> and may you have much joy with your brothers and sister. With a kiss  Your Papa
