Mrs Gundert, Mangalore

 Mang <Cochin>* 6 May 57
My dear wife

It is nearly too late for writing and I donot know when this will reach you. But so much in a hurry - with new pens what a misery for an unaccustomed hand. - I arrived this noon here. Monday morning we were but abreast Casergode, Tuesday morning off Cannanore, but then came a good NW wind instead of the former Southerly breeze and about 4 PM we were before Calicut, in the morning only 12 miles N of Cochin. Then again contrary winds till 10 o'clock, landed about 11 - then everything contrary, baggage not to be got before 2 PM, at Whitehouse other guests and some stiffness so only write now Good evening after having dined there and remain with love to all  Your HG.

news tomorrow if there are any
