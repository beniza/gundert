+ [Mitte May 57]

My dear David.

Now, middle of May 57 you ought to be at Basle, and I half believe you are there I had a bad dream in my Pattimar on the 4th of May, as if I met Mr and Mrs BÃ¼hrer and asked them after my David, but they would not or could not tell. Then I thought that is all nonsense, the dear Lord has brought you safely home, and only because I have seasickness my stomach plays some trick to my head. -

Dear Mama is now very much alone, therefore we want sister Mary to come out and bear her company. I have been at Cochin and saw 5 ships at anchor, but the Seringapatam was not amongst them. Then I paid a visit to Mr Beutler and he told me how he saw you on board the ship and you and Adele Fritz asked him, to take you on shore, as you liked rather to stop in India, than go to Europe. I hope you now like Europe. It will soon be very fine with Cherries and berrys and every kind. You have heard Zacharias ate berries in the Coorg jungle and died of Cholera. Also Hermann the brother of Annie died there

 ...1 Now good bye and the Lord keep you.
 Your Papa.
