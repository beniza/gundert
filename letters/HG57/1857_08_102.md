My dear wife

Yesterday evening I preached to about 30 soldiers Thomas etc were also there. I was very tired when going to bed for we had twice bible readg in the house with Lieut Clemons (nephew of Colonel Cl. and his sister Polly) and his compagnon, Syme, a rather restless young man who has no appointmt now. But I felt that the day was spent to some purpose. This morning Dr Cleghorn arrived and a Dr Williams. The first is an old friend of Groves and was at Mang one day in the Engl. service. I was soon familiar with him and found real pleasure in his company. He blamed S.M. especially for extravagance, f.i. M. had 8 Coolies, whilst C. was content with 4. No wonder if the pay will not suffice. Clegh. was glad to hear that M. turns more to the side of faith and takes real interest in his welfare. - I sent today Changara to Cuttipuram where Dixon is; and will follow tomorrow early, on Wednesday (12) to Ponany.

Now farewell The Lord be with you
 Yours HG
