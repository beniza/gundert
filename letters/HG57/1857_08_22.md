My dear wife

Already Saturday, the examination of the Engl School nearly over. I am glad to be so far done with work. Tomorrow Lord's Supper. This evening we are to see the Brigrs. I visited them however yesterday already. He talked a good deal about the scarcity, for rice is now not to be had at all, do what you like. It is perhaps good for some grand purpose which we cannot find out, but meanwhile the people are very miserably off. - The school is better than I could have anticipated. Lehm is really nice - he told his wife the other day, when their infant was sick - this is perhaps because you found fault with the colour! She cannot yet look into my eyes: but is less against old Hebich than she was. Her relations must be very angry with the Germans. - Charlie has not yet made her appearance. If I can I will visit Chovva this evening. No news from any quarter.

So good bye and may the Lord care for all your cares We need not trouble ourselves for what is ours - if only we did more for what is His 
 Love to all
 Yours HG
