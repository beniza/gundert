 Monday 29 <Juni 1874>*
Dear papa

I have been to church afterward by Mrs. Seeger who has pretty good news from Mrs. Zahn, then I went to Steinhaus were they wonder to have no news from Heidelberg and we to have none from Bale, but it may still come for we know that our dear papa is dilligent in writing

We are preparing the wash to wash the two next days, so the herlichkeit of rest will be over. I am thankful for the last few days of quietness which we had, Apropos, for Mr Hesse the Comity must not give more then 30 kr* per month, it is less difficult than before and no fire.

Mr. Kuppeler is near his end 8 days ago he complained of having great pains in the stomach, since that he has passed no walter urine; but blood, much fever much thirst, two men are watching every night; poor Resele feels very tired and weak. but I think that on the whole he will not be regretted like the mother I do not know why. Yours through Emelie has just come at 5 Oc So poor Mr Hesse had to walk with his lagage, please give him love and to all who know me, are the Ramsyers there? So David will soon come according his last letter.

 Adieu dear papa
 Yours JG.
