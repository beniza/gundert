My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last which has given me much joy. Now that you have the Lord you can discern the different spirits with whom you meet, the Lord is very gracious to you giving you out of His fulness grace for grace. You want much wisdom to deal with so many curious peopel and hither to you have been kept and lead murvelously, to our Lord and father be praise. 
I have been at Wildbad with Uranie three weeks it has done her good, she had much joy to have your letter translated to her by Marie, she sends you all much love, she remains still a few weeks, then will return to Corcelles, Frederic is not yet better, it seems the care for his son troubels him. We have much rain these days, and it is not warm, I am alone with Uranie as papa and Hesse are in Bale Jettle in Heidelberg, we have wash to inturrupt the happy rest I had three days, David will soon come it appears he has already left his place, will travel to Hamburg, Barmen etc. and from Heidelberg come to us, In your last you did not say any thing of dear Tinnes health I trust that she is well with your two beloved daughters, to whom and Mama and yourself I send hearty love and kisses

 Yours affectly
 JG.
