 <8 August 1874.>*
1My dear Children <Fried>*

I thank you heartily for all the troubel you have kindly taken for me about the Steinkohlen, I have spoken with our post meister who will take half of it; but he will first inquire from Mr Wagner here who has a mine of Kohlen from where perhaps we might get some. At all event I can do nothing till I hear again from Mrs. postmeister.

We are with you in thoughts and pray our Lord to keep you quiet and calm in Him who will care for dear Emma and your faith alone can enabel us to remain quiet in Him when anxiety pursues us. It is good for you that your dear wife takes everything quietly, it helps you Uranie has not as yet written, I wrote her yesterday and hope to hear soon. With hearty love to dear Emma to Mrs. Heerman, and with kisses
 Yours

It must be a great comfort for Emma to have her Mama near. I am so glad for her
