My dear Children [Hermann]

I cannot let these days pass away without sending you a word, how nice would it be to have a Christmas together with papa Mama and the two modeste daughters. I suppose they have great joy to make a present and to recieve one. Were you in Calw Grosspapa would have fine books and pictures; but no goodle as we have agreed to make none Maries children get planty from their Mama and other relations, there is no need nor of goodle nor of toys, I hope they shall one day sai like Julia: plays as the Lord had would I like to have and be a child as He was. I hope that you have all a good Christmas; the presence of the Lord with His blessings, And how is dear Mama, are her hands pretty well inspite of the cold? and dear papa who was not yet quite well when he wrote? dear Marle will injoy the Hallydays I suppose with the whole family for papa to have some days of rest is also good, that is without school, preaching he has, may God give life to many. 
Adieu dear children and grd children
 With a kiss to each yours J. G.
