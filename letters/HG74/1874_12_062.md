My dear Children [Hermann]

The letters of Julie and Marie have caused us much joy; all that which they say and relate has amused and pleased us; has one of them reveiled us a secret? is indeed a Samuel or a Tinne expected? how glad would we be if the Lord would give you such joy. Tinne is a very fine name the mother of papa was called so. Dear Julia would like to know which play the Lord did. I think the plays which you have, if you have His presence now and then are right. I dare say He had to suffer from other children, as he had afterward when grown up from His own brothers.

We feel very thankful to the Lord that the health of dear Tinne is so good, we hope her hands will remain well during the winter.

Rikele was glad to hear her name mentioned by you, she sends kind regards she has less to do since Johanes has left us. Marie likes her own housekeeping she feeds her husband so well that he shall perhaps do like Frederic who is becoming very staut, peopel in Calw were quite astonished to see him at Maries wedding he may become like his Uncles or papa, their Julia gives them much joy, their letters are full of praise.

With much love and hearty kisses to every one of you
 Yours affectionate J. G.

The copper vessel which you gave us has been very useful and appreciated
