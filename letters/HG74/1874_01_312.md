+ Dr. Gdt an seine Enkelin Mar. in Mt Clemens

 Calw 31 Jan 1874.
My dear Marle.

That is a very fine letter indeed which you have sent me, so soon after printing the first! How very wonderful that we can write to each other. So I know now what nice things Christmass has brought you, and hope they last longer than with Carle who has soon finished them off. You heard perhaps how he prays: Mein Herz mach rein etc and adds: Und weil mein Herzle so klein ist, so darfst au deine Fussele nausstrecka Thodo was the other day very lightminded, did not think of his tasks, but ran about in the streets with his stilts till 7 o'clock. Then he was punished by his Mama and had to sit and write till 8 o'clock. But in the morning he told her: I have wept very much when I was in bed and I have asked the Lord to help me that I can make you some joy today. You may fancy that his Mama was very glad of that. Do you also know that your Pa has written us a letter in verses on the postcard. Mrs Scheffel was quite red, when one spoke of it and then it came out that she had read it on the staircase before bringing it to us. So there was plenty laughing. Your letters they cannot read so easily and mine also not. You will not show this to your friends but keep it for yourself and dear Julia.

 A kiss from your Grandpa.
