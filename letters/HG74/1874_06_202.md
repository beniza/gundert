My dear wife

From Herm. a short letter, he was on his way to Chicago, saw Edward's widow at Annarbor and was pleased to find all so well, no difficulty about their sustenance. Only Selma was sick with typhoid fever. The mother was however "sehr wohlgemuth." Curious she is rather lutheran, but Selma Baptist, not as much from conviction as because Edw. engaged the sympathies of the Baptists by having her baptized when 13 years old! H. went to a synod to Chicago.

Here all pretty much as usual. I was Thursday at Stammh. saw George for a moment. No resolution as yet what to do with him. I could not talk longer and came away after 3 o'clock.

Fred will come this evening. But I have tomorrow to preach for Bunz, must therefore go to MÃ¶ttling and do not know whether Fred can come along. Anyhow we shall see each other this evening.

I hope you have had pretty warm days. There was no walk yesterday evening, so we played in the Saal to exercise our limbs.

Love from all to all!
 Yours HG
