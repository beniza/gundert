 Calw 2d July 1874

My dear Emma

What can I wish you that you have not got already, in the Lord Jesus who is your life you have every thing, so I can only wish you His holy presence continually, all His gifts you have in Him may He abide in your hearts by faith and make you a blessing for many.

I thank you for the last letter which I got since papa has left us, he will I suppose have writen you from Bale.

Frederic has writen a letter from Aeshi pres de Thune, he seems to feel some what better, he remembers with joy the day he has spent with you and sends you hearty love, Uranie too who is pretty well, she does not write, hopes you accept through me her best love and good wishes. She sends as well as myself love to our two friends who are with you, we are glad for the fine weather they have. With love and hearty kiss
 yours affectly J. G.

Dear Jettle will be surprise that Mr. Kappler has died the first July, I thank for her kind letter.
