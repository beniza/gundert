My dear Children <Fried>*

I am rejoicing in hope that papa shall be with you in eastern so that you shall have a good time together D.V. I hope you had joy with the last visit you have just had, my dear Emma will have had many things to hear from her friend which may be useful in her present time, Marie H. made me the confident on the future plans how she shall be your nurse and Mama the adviser, I think that you are quite right, the good humbel Marie shall prove to be a useful and fine help for mama and baby inspite of her doubts on her capacity.

Uranie sends you hearty love, She hopes to come to Wildbad where I shall be obliged to accompany her if Frederic does not come there with his wife, he is not decided between Canstadt and Wildbad.

We are with you in our thoughts and wish you joy in all what you are doing for our Lord, live to Him die in order to live is our daily task. May He be glorified in all our saying and doing. One has hope to see you here once more before the appearence of the expected one I shall be very glad to see you I am so often with you in thoughts that to see you in reality will be a very great joy for your affectiona
 J.G.
