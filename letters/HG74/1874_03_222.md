My dear Children [Hermann]

I am as you see still in this world, and thank you heartily for your dear letter which has given me joy, That is right that you do not take amiss what we write though it may be now and then not quite so pleasant, but if we do not tell you the truth or at least that which we mind to be right who shall tell it you? yes dear Children we know we feel that the time is short, and we are to follow the Lord fully. I do not remember to have written you about imagination I had likely just read something in Steinhofer which made me to write however it is needful to watch against our imagination which cheats us fearfully, to become a child and have all our thoughts brought to the obedience of the faith is not easily done specially for clever persons.

I am much rejoiced to hear that the hands of dear Tinne are pretty well take it as from the Lord from whom we can expect much ye every thing. I am so glad to know my dear Tinne and the two pets is Marle pretty strong? here she appeard weak and very delicat, and Julie already a help for Mama. Since some weeks I have not heard from Corcelles nor Clarens.

Adieu my very dear Children and grandchildren
 With a tender kiss
 yours J.G.
