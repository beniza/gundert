Good morning dear papa

We hope that you had a good journy and are well in Bale although Frederic is no more there. Of us you had already news from Mr Muller who was very glad to have spent the night here, he felt refreshed after 5 hours of sleep. Here all is as usal, we injoy the rest and quietness which the emptied house procures us. Have you perhaps to preach today? Tomorrow I shall D. V. pay a visit to Steinhaus with Uranie, With us it rains, specially yesterday at 4 the time you were reaching Bale it poured down by tounts. 
I do not go to Church this morning as it is usually very long; but after noon I hope as I understand the Helfer better than the Decan, 
The letter of Herman is very nice one feels that Jesus is his life, that he will not deal without Him that is much for a man like Herman who was led away by his own feelings, so unsetled, and unconsider at The Lord Jesus has him; Him be praise May you have a good sunday and may God rule and guide all at the feast

 With love Yours Julie G.
