My dear Children <Fried>*

After having sent off my little note it occured to me that I had not even given my dearest Frederic a bit of meat or any thing victual for the tripp to Heidelberg. so headless and thoughtless I was, My dear son it is good that you have a wife who cares better than your mama. pardon me. 
I am really glad that we have now some rest; for body, soul and spirit. I want it I felt as if I had lost the peace and joy of the Lord during the last weeks. My good Emma who can keep quiet in the midst of business has a great adventage, But what, in all these things I have to learn if only I get the autority over my nature and will.

Today sunday it rains much with us, I hope that Julie is satisfied with the bottle beside her Mama, she will drink much quicker at the bottle than when she can injoe Mamas breast.

With best wishes for you three and kisses
 Yours affectly
 J. G.
