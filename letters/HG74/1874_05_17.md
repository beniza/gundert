My dear Children <Fried>*

I fancy to see you all going to Manheim, the children admiring the beautiful bridge, they have not been able to injoy the garden much as it rains at least here and it is pretty cold. From Uranie I hear that she intends D.V. to leave Neuchatel on the 23d Saturday and be with you on the same evening with Frederic who accompaneys her, as she could not travel alone, so my dear children I thank you for recieving them in your house, I beg my dear Emma to give them the beds which have been used by Marie and her boys not change the sheets nor pillow cases, You know my sister she would really be grieved if you would not allow her the same bed of her niece just as it is, They shall D.V. spend the sunday with you and come next day to us, My brother intends to return soon again to Neuchatel; for he is not at all well, May the Lord give you for him some words, with the sight of your peaceful abode which may help him to find out what is wanted in him, he has been converted but seems to have lost the joy of his salvation, business more than necessary join to the behaviour of his only son have pulled him down and disturbed the nervous system, The best remedy for this is the sight of the Love of Jesus, faith in His fatherly cares

I thank my dear Marie for having kindly written to Uranie about the journey. I am sorry for the troubel dear Emma shall have, but I know she does it from her heart most willingly and I pray that it may not hurt her to have a continuation of extra labour. I hope Marie injoys her stay with you and that you may be blessed together. Theodor and Carl will have learnt a great deal, Today I met the three little Bauer their friends, they have tried to find or visit you, Papa and Mama Herman have paid us a visit to day

With a hearty kiss to each of you I remain
 Yours affectly J. G.
