 Wildbad 3d Wednesday <3 Juni 1874>*
Dear papa

First of all accept our sincere thanks for having accompanied us, we both could not tell enough how glad we were to have had you for the way. Uranie was so thankful and moved.

We have a very nice room we are in every thing much pleased, before we arrived stood on the table a cake with salutations from Mrs Eitel, this morning for breakfast came a big talliol (hefegrans) <Heffenkranz>* from her again, with the promisse she would soon come. Half past 8 came dear Mama with Emma who will remain till tomorrow, the door which separates our rooms has been taken away and we are like in one room with Mama, she is quite pleased of our loging, all is right, It is good that Jettle wrote; for some body came just after her letter who wanted the small room;

Emma brought the Shawl from Mrs R white not very large Cashmire it seems it can be wash like cloth.

I long to hear how you came home dear papa and how you slept? 
It is very hot here the sun shine through three windows, the forth on the side of the river Enz gives us cool air, the little room of Mama has but one window and she could scarsly live in it if the rooms were not in each others on account of the air.

Now with hearty love to each of you from us both I trust that I shall soon have joy by letters from dear Marie, Jettle, from you dear papa I know quite sure. Love from Mama and Emma,

Adieu with salutations to all I hope that Mr Hesse is well and his brother recovered from the attack which had troubeld him

With many thanks
 Yours affectly Julie Gundert
