My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for yours of 16 Apr which gives me much joy The Lord Jesus has become your Lord and your life; without Him you can not live, it is right and with Him we have every thing for this life and next one, by His grace we learn to deney self in order to follow Him; but some time it is hard for the old man I feel it and these last days more than ever, This one command of Jesus about love true love, tenderness, finds in me much resistance to work hard make even some sacrifice is to me more easy than to love. I begin to think that I have not yet understood what is that love the chief and repeated command of my Lord, it is no easy thing to love in reality, with Gods grace I will now try to know to study what is love without increasing in the knowlege of my Lord towards me I shall not succeed, He loves me inspite of my disobedience, pride naughtiness, wickedness, What have I to do towards others? O it is humbling to know one self what depth of patience and longsuffering has our Lord. His name be praised.

I rejoice to hear that your dear pets are obedient and continue to give you joy

Many kisses to them but especially to my dearest Tinne and yourself May the Lord make you a blessing for the congregation

 adieu yours afftly J.G.
