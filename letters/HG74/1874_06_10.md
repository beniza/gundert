My dear wife

I have nothing to answer, but would ask whether you received my Friday or Saturday letter, containing a postcard from America? You do not allude to it, and I ought to send the contents on to Heidlbg and Bremen. Have you perhaps sent it direct, or did you return it to me? in which case the letter seems to be lost I got as yet but 2 letters from you.

We are all glad that Grandma is so well, but dear Ur. seems to make slower progress, may it at least prove lasting. - I wrote yesterday to Blumhdt about Mrs Zahn as Mrs Seeger wished me to do so, and gave the mother another letter today for Boll, as she judged it best to depart thither without farther delay although there had been no answer received from Bl. Now they will we at Boll both ladies together and Bl has telegraphed that there is no obstacle to their coming.

It is I think E S's birthday and Jett went over and made her a present of a book. This evening she has the privilege of accompanying us on the walk. 
I do not come any more into the steinhaus, as I walk in the evenings and sleep about noon. We have it dreadfully hot I fancy.

Roos (Paul's friend) and Oehler are now in London as I hear from thence. I hope they visit also Scotld.

Now farewell and may the good Lord bless your stay there! With love to Gr.M and Uranie
 Your HG.
