My dear Children [Hermann]

I am sorry if my note has made you uneasy; but when I thought that John and Marie would be called to Bale as one supposed I thought surly papa wants his son to help him; and I hope that it is but a plan which shall be realised some what later, as John is in Calw one year longer, if the Lord spare us I hope to see you with us,

Our new married peopel are very happy they are like two children. they care for each other, the two boys happy to have a papa who is very good to them and can play also with them, they are indeed more obedient than they used to be, they have great respect for papa who can also be severe when needed. 
All the news you gave us of your work, cleaning, about mama and children pleased us much, we are specially glad to hear that the hands of dear Tinne are so well and hope it will continue so. We had a great deal to do the last weeks with Marie changing house cleaning, wash marriage etc. Tinnes help would have been well come I often think of you all

adieu dear children and grandchildren with a kiss
 yours JG
