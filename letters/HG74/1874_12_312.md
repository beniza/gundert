My dear Children [Samuel]

I will let this year enden without sending you a word of love, About the wedding of Marie you have heard of course. I had much joy to see dear Jetthen on that day, one feels that she grows in the knowlege of the Lord. the many little difficulties in the family bring her nearer her Lord. I estime and love her dearly, Is your health dear Elisabeth as good at Mangalore as it was on the hills? Is the old Hanna in the poor house still alive if so please give her my love, she was one of my best friends among the black pepel. If only I could remember the names, there are many to whom I would like to send love and message. Do you ever hear from Mrs. Diez? she has a good number of children is it not?

Are you learning Tulu or Canarise? Can you already speak with the women and Children. May God give you words of life for them with much love, Hoave you ever heard of Ellene since she left you?

Wishing you both many blessings for the new year with joy. accept both a tender kiss from
 yours JG.
