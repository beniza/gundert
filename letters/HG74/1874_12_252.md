My dear Children [Hermann]

What you send me a present? O my dear I should send you a present and how gladly would I do it if we could communicate more easily, but now I accept with many thanks your gift at first I would not hear of it, now I shall buy me something useful that you shall see when you once come to Calw, it shall give me no less pleasure nor be less useful than the pan of cupfer to cook fruits which you have kindly given me. Today we have received the Cards from New York about Georgs verlobung, very curious he send them all to us, for Frederic G and did not pay enough he need not to spare he possess more than we; but never mention a word about it it is perhaps a mistake in the excitement.

I hope you have had a fine Christmas time with Mama the Children and the congregation! Since a week Marie keeps the room having much toothach even after having had three of them taken away by a dentist in Stutgart, so that the begining of their happy home is some what disturbed also by the long vacation of his brother from Salon. whom as he says himself eats and drinks as much as three. they have but a young girl who cannot couk and Marie not permitted to go to the cookroom so an invitation is wellcome; but they are nice, he cares for the children and his wife it seems to do him good, Jettle and papa are telling you all the news Louis Dubois has been very ill, his wife is newly converted it gives great joy may he get blessings from her. With love and tender kiss to each of you
 Yours J. G.
