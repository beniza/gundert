Dear Children.

May the Lord give that papa Mama the dear babe be filled with the words of the text of the 27th August Yea may our Lord give it, continually much prayers for selves for His Kingdom, Getting ansewrs, many good gifts and a heart full of praise and thanks without interuption.

Schn체rle got from some one a thaler to be put in sparcash for his babe, in giving me that thaler he said I know that the best sparcast is the mission, the Lord must have it, this is for you alone, for if the person owh gave it would hear of it she might get very angry

You give your selves anew with your child to the Lord He cares for you and your affaires, have your delight in the Lord He shall greant you your requests,

We have much joy that the Lord has been so gracious, we hope to see and hear soon the dear daughter With best wishes for dearest Emma the baby and you all.

 Yours affectly

1Morgen soll ich nach Crailsheim also nur herzlichen Gl체ckwunsch, der Bf freute uns sehr. Jetzt wirst oft beim Erwachen fragen: Jaso ich bin Vater! ist das Kind noch da? lebts noch? und hast es Stundenlang vergessen gehabt. Darum wars aber doch nicht vergessen, sondern Einer hat immer dran gedacht, als h채tte Er sonst nichts zu thun und 체brig Zeit!
