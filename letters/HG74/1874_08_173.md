 <17 Aug 74.>*
My dear Frederic

Regarding the Steinkohl I really do not know what to do. if Hesse does not spend the winter with us I could do with out Kohl, and if he is here I shall buy for him by Muller as I did last winter, than when my provision of Coaks is finished in the spring I shall troubel you to buy for us, though I could not find any one to take half of it. I shall keep it all; So till the spring I shall manage with that which we have helping with lowcase <LohkÃ¤s>* and Rinde. I am only sorry to have troubled you.

So your best half is working preparing making every thing easy for the time she shall no more be able to do things herself. Dear Emma till now we had but joy in you both, what a different thing is it to have the Lord, to live from Him and to Him, or to be half and half.

Marie has just been with me weeping feeling that she has not been with us as she should have been, the cause is for being not with the Lord what she should have been. pray for her that there may be some work to God' praise 
Adieu my dear Children love to dear Mama
 yours JG.
