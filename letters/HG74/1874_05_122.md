My dear Children [Samuel]

By your last letter we see that dear Elisabeth is not well it is perhaps still the fatigue of the journey, and we hope that it will soon pass away. It is a comfort for us to feel that she is not alone as formerly there are many sisters who will gladly help her and comfort her, you have likely great heat while we are still obliged to make fire in the ovens we had frost and snow in Mai one feared much for the fruits, grapes even for corn; but till now it has by Gods grace not spoiled so much people cry always more than it is, if God spare what remain it will be sufficient. 
Emma Gundert was here by her parents 10 days we had much joy to see her, Frederic wrote of course every two days, they are a happy cuppel, one feels that the Lord is with them, Marie with her boys will soon be with them in Heidelberg during the vacances, and I shall be obliged to go to Wildbad to help Uranie and Mama who shall come from Stutg to bathe hoping it will be good for the headache she suffers from I would much rather stay here, but I am to say not my will be done

Adieu dear Children
 yours affectly JG.
