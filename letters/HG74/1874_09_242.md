My dear Children <Fried>*

We were glad to have again such good accounts of you all except that dearest Emmas breast is not yet well. Yesterday I paid a visit to Mrs Zahn Shoemaker who got also a baby on Suterday, she has the same complaint as Emma, she had it already of her Child last year, she says that after some weeks it will pass away, it is heat she thinks which produces it. I do hope that it will soon pass away; for it is very painful.

Do you not begin soon to give some milk or breile to the baby besides Mamas Milk? she may pull down Mama too much!

Dear Marie will be a perfect nurse, it is very good for you that she can remain so long, a baby takes a great deal of time, it is good that she sleeps at night. David is quite proud to hear that she looks like him. 
Wishing you three peace and joy and good appetite to the baby with rest and good nights
 Yours affectionate JG.
