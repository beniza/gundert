My dear Children <Fried>*

Accept my sincere thanks for your last which as ever has given me great joy, yes dearest Emma we are indeed happy peopel with our Lord, His will being our will all is then perfectly right whatever it may be. Now papa is telling me that he is going to send off his letter to you so take for good these few words. Uranie sends you hearty love, she is pretty well. 
This evening or rather after noon Marie had a large party for caffee amongst which was dear Anna Fecht Mrs Fink, I had joy to see both one feels that the Lord is with them.

Adieu my very dear children Wishing you joy and peace
 Yours affectly
 J. G.

Many thank for the many fine cherises
