 <Calw ca. 26 Novb 74.>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

I was very glad to hear that you came home happy, safe and found all well even that Julia drunk Cows milk; Apropos the milk should not be pure but a third of water with it, Cows milk is too good for a baby too rich. Dearest Emma after Frederic had left I felt so uneasy not to have sent a piece of cake pardon me please; but I was so nervous and excited that it did not occur to me to send you any thing, if Frederic could have taken a bottle of wine it would have done me great pleasure,

We begin to rest a little which we need very much, A propos about Christmas it has been settled last year that we give nothing to each other. I forgot to talk about it as you were here; but you are I trust of the same mind. We love each other and pray for one another without making presents. Let us know whether the milk agrees with your dearling. Marie and Johannes are well. the children most happy

Adieu my very dear Children
 With a kiss to you three
 Yours affectly J. G.
