Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind letters Emma was still here when it came thursday for noon. Wednesday eving we went four together to take a wash bad in the Burger bad where it cost less and no less comfortable nor clean than in the other, the water is less worm than in the big bad, that s the place in Chatherine Stift where Mrs Moereke used to bath with her Children. Mama and Uranie were alone this morning at 5 I shall only bath 2 or 3 times in a week not to get so nervous. Yesterday evening I accompanied Emma to the train, from there I paid a visit to Mrs Eitel who as ever I found very nice and affectionate, she would have come to see us but wash and other things had made empË†chement She sends love to all; but specially to her dearest Henriette and thanked papa much for having recieved her neveu <(Ernst Gess)>*

Our good Mama likes the air and walking so much that there is scarsly any time at home, of course poor Uranie comes too, and it is good for her troz her not liking to move far, it is cool today and it looks as if it were to get rain No Miss von Klugen is to be seen Mrs von Rucktashel leaves us alone it is good

Dear Marie and Jett accept my sincere thanks for good letters Adieu 
Mama sends much love to all. My love to all in the house and vis a vis
