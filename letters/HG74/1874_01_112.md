My dear children <Fried>*

Again good news from you I have no greater joy than to hear that you both try to do something in your Lords kingdom. May He give his blessing and make you joyful in it with true humility: for we are unworthy of such a high calling; but He has brought us out of darkness to His light that we may proclaim His virtues Ye His great unspeakabel love. Yesterday I visited Mrs Sch√ºz who has been very ill as you will have heard from Julie who visits her often, she is very thankful for her visits it does her good she told me; She is a fine soul growing in the knowlege of the Lord, trials are good, they bring us to the feet of Jesus. I brought her the work of Steinhofer on the epistel of John, she was glad. I read today with joy in his works on Romer the 13th Chp on election it is very clear and nice; I trust that you have a good sunday. I went to Hirsau with Hesse who had the meeting as papa has a cold he could not go. Are not the letters of Herman delightful. One feels that the Lord has truly His work in him. Now Adieu my very dear Children
 Yours affectly J.G.
