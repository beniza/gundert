My dear Children <Fr.>*

I hope you are well and happy with your dear Mama Herrman waiting for the time of troubel and joy, by Sh√ºrle it goes very well that child twice given up is strong and healthy, the mama too, the child will not drink her milk without a glass as one has now which is a relief for the mutter. 
Now dear son it is to troubel you that I write, I expected Steinkohl from Ludwighaffe, but it does not go as Mr. Fecht can only do it for Fabricks where one has other.

So I come to ask you to tell me how much one pays for 100 Centner with you and if it is good, also do you know how much the transport would be from Heidelberg, how much contain the smallest vagon as it would be cheaper to get a vagon I may perhaps get some one to take a part of it if it is more than 100 Centner Here one pays 1 fl 12 Cr per 100 pd The Coaks we had is so bad that I will try Steinkohl as you have yourselves. I am sorry to give you troubel dearest Frederic; but I do not know how to manage and I know that you will gladly help me if you can.

With hearty love to my very dear Emma to dear Mama

 Yours affectionate
 J Gundert
