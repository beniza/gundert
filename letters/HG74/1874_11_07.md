My dear Children <Fried>*

You will feel the loss of dear Marie, and the little one shall no more be carried about by her Aunt dear Emma will feel it; but I trust the Lord will give her the strength which she need, she must not exert herself too much nor feed her baby so as to become weak by it, is Julia taking breile or cows milk? all the description you give us of her interest us; now dear Marie who is expected will tell us a great deal about her and you all. So in a fortnight you come yourself too, if it was summer one would hope to see dear Mama with her pet along but one must wait till the next spring to see that little one which makes so much joy, The little Schn√ºrle is getting on better; but he does not try to lift up his head, Till now the Lord has been very good and gracious to you. Him be praise and thanks. I have got from Wagner 55 Centner Coals Sar Kohlen at 51 Creuz per centner; but it is an unpleasent thing it is every where dirty and black, do you wet yours before using them?

May the Lord keep and bless you with the dear baby. With a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours affectly JG.

Give my love to Mrs. Zimmerman I have pity with <her>* leg it is a sad complaint which may dure a long time
