 Wildbad <6/8 Juni 1874.>*
My dear Children in Heidelberg

I think that I have not yet written you a line since Frederic and Uranie were with you, they were so pleased to have seen your happy home and felt very thankful for your kindness to them, they could not tell enough how good you had been for them.

You will already have heard that papa had the kindness to accompany us till W. which we appreciated very much; for I had then not to care for anything. 
Mama is with us, feels herself pretty well except the headache from which she suffers specially at night. Emma Blebst brought her, we had real joy to see her, she is such a fine soul one can but profit by her company. she remained till the next day, her Georg is just now in Bale.

Uranie feels nicely she can walk better than last year, we talk often of you, she sends you love, thanks and hearty kiss

There are few people here except the poor who are obliged to come, for health. formerly the roads were filled with elegante toilettes; but now we see less. Tow years ago my good Frederic visited us here and was very sad, his heart was full of Emma; but no certainty that he might get her one day, hopes and doubts moved him about; And now God has brought you together and made you so very happy. His name be praised! from Him and to Him we will live to His praise.

 Adieu my very dear Children
 yours J. G.
