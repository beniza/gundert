My dear Children [Hermann]

It is already a fortnight <nein! bald 4 Wochen, denn das Letzte hatte Mama 3. Jan. geschrieben!)>* since I wrote you a few lines, today is our Pauls birthday, it is soon three years that he was taken to rest, soon we shall see him again, the time is short. Your last was a card which amused us, 
You will have heard from papa that we have visits therefore little time, however in thoughts much with you, some time ful of joy and at other time fears, why fears? The Devil is so cunning presents himself as an Engel of light or as a roaring lion. but our Lord is stronger than him, only we must remain as children, cleaving very close to our Lord, distrusting ourselves more and more. I hope that God will make you a blessing for the congregation, and that some will come to ask what they are to do to possesse the joy and hapiness which you injoye. Our greatest enemy is our imagination, our reason to watche over these, is very difficicult, they lead us quickly away from the truth, even picturing beautiful and holy things before us, but the heart is decietful above all, therefore watch and pray, is to be exercised,

What is doing my dearest Tinnâ€š the dear pets? I send to each of them and yourself a tender kiss
 Yours affectly JG.
