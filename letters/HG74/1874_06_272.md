My dear Children <Fried>*

I cannot leave Jettle go without sending you a word, not that you need it to be assured of my love, I feel so joyful and happy when I think of you both, and I praise the Lord to have given you such a mind to live to Him who has loved you first, and work for Him who has redeemed you from this wicked world I trust that you shall have a good and blessed time with our friends, redeeming the time as the days are evil. I wish you His holy presence in all what you do and say. I have much pleasure to send my dear son some socks as I know he can use them or want them having had too few in the begining.

We liked our stay in Wildbad pretty much, Uranie specially is quite satisfied, she thinks that it has done her good, she can sleep well and has good appetite, I feel well too. We are going to have a quiet time alone here, We were glad to have Mama from Stutgart with us. she tryed to bring forward her frensh; but it would not strech far.

Now my very dear children with true love from Uranie and hearty kisses from me I remain Yours shall I say like my good Emma Yours thankful. nine no, she must no more say so but your affectionate: for she loves us no? Yea my dearest Emma from the heart in truth we love each other, so no more your thankful. Adieu my beloved children
 Yours affectly J. G.
