My dear Children <Fried>*

Papa has already told you how surprised I was in recieving the box which I had sent you, had I then thought of my birthday being so near I would not have sent it you; now what shall I say except to thank you very much for all specially for your love, All that which you say about your pet interests us, she will soon know her Mama, and her good Aunt Marie, she will feel it when she has no more got it to do her mamas work, she will then cry in her bed waiting till mama can take her up, and she will learn to drink quicker to leave mama more time, I hope her eye is getting well that is no more matters coming out. The joy with children is usually mixed with cares, in order that we look to the Lord and learn to wait with faith upon Him. 
Nothing is too small nor too great all is to be taken from Him, faith grows by exercise of prayers caused by troubels or need. I think this time will also prove to be blessed for dear Marie inspite of fatigue and much work. I fancy to see papa carry the baby in singing, it is good that you have not many night songs as we had, your papa than sung in many languages. With hearty love to each of you three and baby
 Yours affectly JG.
