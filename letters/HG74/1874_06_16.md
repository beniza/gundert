My dear wife

Cold day, hardly fit for writing! But I have little to say, I hope you don't freeze! What a time in June, will dear Uranie say, and wonder about the Schwarzwald and its changes!

I am to tell you, that if you leave Wildbad 4.15 afternoon, you can go by Brötzingen or by Pforzheim (till 5 o'clock) leave Pforzheim at 5.5 (or Brötzingen 5.12) and be here 6.4. If we know the time, we will fetch you from the Bahnhof to be sure.

Yesterday evening after accompanying Miss Kern we went home, did shake our cap and handkerchf out of Marie's windows for her, without being - I fear - observed, and then I was in Steinhaus and related about your being nonplussed by the gifts you received. Mrs Heerm could not evade the question of Mrs Schütz about your address. So we are all surrounded by high treason. I hope you have now recovered from that fright or alteration and took the thing in good part. We had a long talk I then saw Hesse in bed without light and hope he is pretty well though he feels the cold in his room. I half thought of changing the room again, but who knows, the noon may bring something better in the shape of weather.

Good bye now. With love to all the Kleeblatt
 Your HG
