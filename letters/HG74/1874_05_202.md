 <20/21 Mai 74.>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

I am really sorry for you that you shall have much troubel for Uranie as they come so late the evening You will be so kind dear Frederic to take a Einspenerle to take them home as it is rather far to your house from the termine, I beg dear Emma not to remain up so long and take care of herself. If Uranie will see the schloss one must take a carriage; for she could not walk and she likes to see new things. I only fear for your troubel. 
Give them please my love You will know the best time for them to come on Monday at noon ore early the morning, they better come by Stutgart, <Zuffenhausen>1 Uranie likes the 3d class more than the second with a pillow she sits more comfortabel she told me last year; but you shall hear from them, I know you will care for them and I thank you heartily for it 
Adieu my dear Children
 Yours affectly JG.

Love to dear Marie and to her boys
