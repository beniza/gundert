+ Dr. Gundert an seine Enkelin in Mt Clemens

 Calw 7 Jan 1874.
My dear Marle!

I want you to see, what Theod has written to congratulate his parents on New years day (drauf stand: Gott schenke euch Kraft und Gesundheit, Weisheit und Geduld etc). When I asked him, whether God has not already given us enough of patience, or whether they both, Carl and Theod foresaw that they would try our patience yet more in this year, so that we required a new measure of it, he merely laughed. They write these wishes in the school and copy from a letter printed or written by the master. I wonder what you said to Papa and Mama? Have you also the word: "Prosits Neu Jahr" That is what I wish to you and sister. Prosit, which means: may you profit by the new year in all respects! We wish you had also some of our goodies. But I think your Mama gives you the best.
 Now farewell -
