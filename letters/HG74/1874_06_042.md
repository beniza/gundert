My dear Children in America [Hermann]

A few words from Wildbad where I am with Uranie and Mama, Emma has accompanied mutter here and has remaind two days, her husband is just now in Bale. Mama has good deal of pain in the head specially by night, she sends you hearty love. Uranie is pretty well, better than last year, she can walk lighter. We speak often together of you all, the face of each of you pictures itself for our eyes, but especially we rejoice of the faith our dear Lord Jesus has given you, this is the valuabel thing it is that which is to be excercised, and often through trials and hard things if only we keep to our Lord. The mystery, dying to self and live in Jesus or Jesus in us is to be daily better known and exercised. Your letters give us much joy Jesus is your life and your whole it is enough, in His own time He shall give you the fruits of your labour. I was grieved to hear dear Tinne had so much toothache; and hoped it might be a sign of pregnency, that her hands were not worse in winter has rejoiced us. In Wildbad there are very few peopel as yet, it is very expensive to live here the dinners which we paid 2 years ago 30 c cost now the doubel,

I was glad to hear the letters of your dear children to us good Julia and Marly they are so very dear to us. We three here send them as well as to you both a hearty kiss

 yours affectly JG.
