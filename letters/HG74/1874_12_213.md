My dear Children <Fried>*

It is already a long time since I wrote to you. I have always a great joy to hear your letters Yes dear Frederle a true joy to hear you relating of your dear wife of your darling. The Lord is gracious to you both to Him be glory and thanks and should there come other days in which He would appear less gracious by faith you would have grace to say it is all well all things work together for our best, yea for our best our father will see in us the image of His son and to bring this to pass He knows which are the best means therefore we learn to say with our whole heart thy will be done 
Last year we had the joy to see you in our midst; and now the queen in your house keeps you, it is all right till she may come in company. We are however in thoughts together and our wishes for one another come to our heavenly father,

May the Lord bless you both richly, with your child, and make you a blessing for others, Adieu my very dear Children

with a tender kiss to you three
 Yours J G

My brother is in Montreux with his wife they with Uranie send you much love
