My dear Marle

We have all been glad to get a happy new year from you and hope you will be blessed with the same. Miss Smith will be wonderfully pleased with you, when you get better pleased with her, and then you will get such a number of fine cards that your heart jumps for joy. We often talk about you and wonder how the winter is, does it look like having enough of it? This is the time when we are accustomed to burials; you know perhaps your uncles Paul and Charles Isenberg were buried in this month and I come just from a grave where an old Mama of 70 years found her resting place. Her son was bad and ran away to America where he became soldier and 10 years ago he died in an hospital: an only son Today she has been buried, the old Mrs WÃ¼rz. It rained and snowed and was a fearful dirt, nearly like Michigan dirt. Her 2d. husband whom she married 10 years ago is 78 years old and will I think follow her soon. Other news I have none just now, therefore good bye and may you soon have a fine spring! With a hearty kiss your  Opapa
