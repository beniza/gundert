Dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your kind letter to me and for all the dear letter which every week rejoice our heart what has not the Lord done in this past year, how different we feel in hearing of each other, and the only cause is our blessed Lord Jesus who has become the first and last in us. This morning in hearing papa pray I felt so happy thinking we are liked minded with Jesus who would but that the father be glorified and we by His pure grace wish and will but that our Lords will be done, that we become like Him, be minded like He was, first emptied of self, humble, obedient as our Lord is discribed to us in Philipp, what privilege we have to be called the bride, to have communion with the son and with the father, and the promise that we shall be one day like Him when He shall appear.

A few days ago as papa spoke of having windows made in our gast zimmer, at first I thought whats the use if Hesse goes away; but afterward I rejoiced in the hope they will serve for you, I pray the Lord to show you and papa whether His will is not that you help him, till now the expected and wanted help has failed as you see, papa wants really a man to assist him, his health is declining, he can not take long walks as formerly, he has not the strength, his memory seams to give way, one feels that he forces himself as it were to perform his task. I told one day en passant to papa perhaps Herman might come to help you, then he said but Tinne does not like the sea voyage! Good Tinne it would soon be over and here we shall make every thing as comfortabel as we can, you shall have the rooms you like the house keeping as you like, I shall be glad to leave you every thing and rest Your dear peopel of Glatten have sent us good butter with salutations per occasion; We have in mind to call here the one of them who sews as she seeks a place, we would advise her to learn to make dresses in a good establishment made in Calw for young ladies, she may stay with us the three monthes of learning, afterward we think she might get plenty work here as dressmaker which would be much better for her than in a village the next course of learning begins in Februar and lasts three months, many young ladies from here and outward follow the course.

Now I must say adieu to papa Mama and to the dear children with hearty kisses
 yours affetly JG.
