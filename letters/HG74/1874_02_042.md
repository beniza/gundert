My dear Children <Frid>*

Many thanks for your dear welcome letters, and thanks for the two oranges you have so kindly sent me, my dearest Emma you must not spoil me with good things, not always think of Mama when you have some rare good fruits. Yesterday evening we were in Steinhouse, today came papa Mama Heerman with Julie they are so nice mama is most affectionate with me, how things have changed, formerly I would have feard to come near your parents they stood distant and high, but now I like them more and more.

So you have wash please do not exert yourself too much it is not good in your present state.

We have now some rest of which I am glad though Mrs. Hesse is a nice lady our way of living is not for such high peopel at least not for a length of time, though she appeard quite happy in our midst. She has sent a Telegram to congratulate papa today.

My very dear Children I wish you peace and joy in the Lord
