 First January 1874
My dear Children <Fried>*

Many thanks for your kind letters, we were glad to hear so soon of your safe arival at H. inspite of the many fears, it is good I was not with you, for dear Emma would have had to quiet me.

We have been very quiet to day, had no visits and made none, yesterday evening we were for a moment in Steinhaus, as we thought that it might be very full to day. partly on account of dear Anna Sch√ºtz whom we also did congratulate.

We hope that the Lord gave you a good day by His word and His Spirit, the teaching direct of His spirit profits us much more than any thing we hear from men. O may we have opened ears and hearts to his voice and be obedient.

Yesterday we heard that Samuel is to go to Mangalore, we pray the Lord to prepare him for it and do them good there, he may not like to have to work with Greter; but God must know what is right for him.

May the Lord be with you continually keep you, guide you to His praise 
Adieu my very dear Children
 Yours JG.

The words we had in papas room come often in my mind God is light and we are darkness May we be fully convinced of this truth and keep ourselves open to that light who alone can dispel, remouve the darkness. May He shine on us and in* all things make us children of light.
