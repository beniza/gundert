Dear Children <Fried>*

Only a few lines in the name of Uranie who has been much surprised and quite touched by recieving a good affectionate letter from you and such nice steuser with a neckhandkerchief good warm made by dear Emma she was very much pleased and has asked me to tell you to excuse her for not writing herself; but she cannot do it well. So accept through me her best thanks, she is pretty well, but her girl is sickly and dark, that is some what melancholy. Frederic is still in troubel about his son who is in the south with his wife. The business is not going on so that every one has to suffer from it.

I have just seen Mrs. Kapler who is very ill, as much in spirit as in body. We have had wash yesterday and today, I am glad that it is over since we have an addition to our family we have of course much more wash. 
So dear Emma is getting a full face like Frederic we are glad of it. Have you seen again Mrs Leibfried?

May the Lord give you joy in serving, teaching to know the Lord and become like Him is to be our daily study, in getting free from selfrighteousness. 
With best wishes and kisses to each of you
 Yours affectly J. G.
