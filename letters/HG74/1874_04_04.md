Dear papa

Many thanks for your kind letter. (In vain I have suckt, I can find nothing). In Hirsau I paid a visit to the Sprengers and went with her to the burial, the sister of Barbele was much distressed; but glad to see me. Half an hour before her death she was sitting on the saufa and said several times "Kommt er nicht; she spoke much of the blood of Christ and was happy waiting for her Lord, she had wished to be buried on good Friday. During the speach of the Minister the bells were ringing and the horn blown as fire had began in the forest on the tunel before Hirsau, I heard nothing afterward; it has been soon extinguished I suppose inspite of the great wind.

Julia Heerman has just been here, she brought a bouquet for the reception of Jettle and sends love to all of you there,

Emma must not feed you too good else our tabel would no more suffice you! My hearty love to the dear Children, to Frohnmeyer. Emma should not do too much work I send her a kiss. We are all in Heidelberg in our thoughts, 
 With love yours affectly J.G.
