 <16 April 1874.>*
My dear Children <Fried>*

It is time to give you a sighn of life, first of all accept my sincere thanks for your kind letters which me always much pleasure, You are indeed very dilligent both of you, inspite of wash and much work the dear Emma finds always time. I admire her good humour and courage to recieve all the visits which you get so very often. I have taken the liberty to ask Uranie and my brother with his wife to visit you on their way to Calw, they might I think come in one day from Neuchatel to Heidelberg spend a day with you and proceed farther. I do not know as yet when they intend to come but Uranie speaks of the end of Mai to be in Wildbad in June.

I rejoice in the hope my dearest Emma will be abel to come for the great day in Steinhaus, and you my sweet Frederic shall be like a desolate widower, but for a short time, Adieu my beloved Children Wishing you the presence of the Lord and His peace and joy With a tender kiss

 Yours affectly JG
