 First January /74
 <R 1 Febr>*
Dear Children [Samuel]

We hope the Lord has given you a good day as the first of the year. Yesterday we heard that you are to go to Mangalore, as you have wished to return to the low country you may be glad though it is not Malabar, for you dear Elisabeth you will be glad to injoye the society of so many sisters. Samuel may perhaps like it less; but I hope he will get grace to live quietly peasably with the brethren though it might be some what difficult for him. When we are truly humbel we find that Gods will is right and good nature, our own will and understanding has to bent before Him, the knowlege of our self <heart> help us to esteem others better than ourself; and take it for an honneur to be permitted to work in his field whereever it may be and with whom so ever it may be. For your health it will be good too, and we hope that for Elisabeth it will not hurt her. May the the Lord go with you there and help you to praise Him. In the Pfleiderer you have a fine brother and sister, people who speak to ones face and not behind. May God give you wisdom and grace in speaking and dealing.

Adieu dear Children
 Yours afftly JG
