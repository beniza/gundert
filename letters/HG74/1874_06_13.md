1I forgot to tell you that Plebst has seen Ramseyer who is ful of courage, there will appear afterward their life a pretty large vollum. he said the king of Aschente will require greater humiliation till one can bring the Gospel there.

Mrs Supper has got from you in her Album a verse which at first did not please her; but since some time, she repeats it often and thinks it was good for her to get it, I am ashame not to know intirely that verse, "why do men murmur they should murmur on their sins," something like it, I think that she is not far from the Kingdome of God it will be good for her to go to Canstad Uranie is anxious about Frederic having not heard from him since he left Calw, he had promised to write her as he did formerly, that is every week,

I have just got a learge box from Calw full of seelen to eat I suppose it is from Steinhouse Mama sais that they are very good, please to thank there I find a note from Emilie Schüz, with the seelen so she is to be thanked and excuse me for not writing.

When I thought that your train might corespond with the one of Pf. which comes here at 8 I forgot that yours goes to Stutgart; so it can but be for 11 Oc

I have just recieved a large box again from Steinhouse full of Goodle so that Mama and Uranie can live from them, please when you see them to thank She Mrs. H wrote such a nice letter, she took the troubel to write so that I can read it perfectly, it is really too kind of her And as I had put away the box thinking there are but goodly Gmama comes saying "what is in the botom of that box" I look and find three Oranges with sugar / that is meant for the one who does not eat goodle.

Mis. von Klugen came yesterday to see us having heard that I had salutations for her from Emelie Schüz, she asked after Mr John Hesse she sends Him love and he is to know that his advise about praying together has been head and executed in Reval where he had a meeting the ladies specially remember him
