My dear Children <Fr.>*

I was rejoiced to hear that the Mrs Yungs were so much pleased of their staying with you, your mornings and evening prayers in which you rememberd those for whom they had come there has specially touched them, So my dear children by your hospitality you had opportunity to give witness to your Lord. Yea the Lord be praised for this grace which He gave you. 
I was also very glad to hear in secret from Marie Heerman that the hopes have not been disapointed till now; but however we keep it for ourselves! leaving this as all our concerns in our Lords cares.

We are in expectation to see Mrs. Hesse with her younger son who is to remain in Calw for some time. Thats right of you dear Emma to give courage to Anna S in telling her that your meat and vegetabel had not succeeded well it is no small thing to be timide and easily cast down

May the Lord bless you both to His praise
 With a kiss yours JG

we were quite pleased papa and myself to hear that it will be good for her to have you near
