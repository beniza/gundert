 <Sept 74>*
My dear Children [Samuel]

I was lately in Stutgart were I had the pleasure to see your pepel who are well and happy Mama specially looks joyful. I saw Sister Stolz too for the first time, she is well with her baby, the other children do not look very healthy, I was glad to find by Emma Plebst a paquet which was to be sent you for your school girls, I hope that it will rich you in good order and soon, I know by experience what a great joy it is to have something for the children, that is, if it does not create jalousy. I am very glad to hear that you are so happy at Mangalore injoying the company of so many Sisters, Your work among the girls is also to your satisfaction the feeling of being useful makes us happy. May the Lord make you a blessing for their souls and give you the joy to see some fruits of your labour. When you meet some of the women who remember us give them my love specially to Anna in the poorhouse Did you suffer from the heat? This month Sept is beautiful, warmer than August was.

Wishing you both peace and joy in the Lord I remain
 Yours affectionate J. G.
