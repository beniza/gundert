My dear children <Fried>*

Many thanks my dearest Emma for your kind note; it has given me a real joy to hear that you sow Mrs. Leibfried and are willing with Gods grace to be of use to her. Yes dear children take every opportunity to serve your Lord in helping others, when God finds us willing He sends us many souls to be helped and it is a great honnour of the Lord to use us for His work in any way; in this manner we are like our Lord who did not come in this world to be served but to serve and do good. I scarsly remember Mrs Leibfried; but her mother whom we liked well and the young man who died. The Lord has not brought you to Heidelberg to have only your daily bread; but that you both serve to His purpuses, O it is a great thing to be faithful in small things, humbel small for our own eyes; but ready for a call of our Lord. 
May you have joy and peace. I was glad to hear that God kept you so quiet on that saturday and preserved you all. I wish you a good sunday with the children at Lodw

 Adieu with a tender kiss
 yours JG
