 <30 April/1 Mai 1874.>*
Dearest Frederic

Only a few words to thank you for being so kind as to write to Uranie and to recieve her with Frederic when they come to Calw. As soon as you get the new regulations <Fahrtenplan>*, please tell her how she can come from Neuchatel to Heidelberg and how much about it will cost from Bale to this, She is anxious about the change of monney as their monney does not pass here, papa will write to Johanes to arrange all in Bale for them and to take them to the Baden station if they can come in one day to you. My brother is not well and will it seems come only to accompany Uranie and go back to Neuchatel where his wife shall remain

We have great joy to see your dear half, next week we shall see more of her we hope, if it is fine weather I shall sit in their garden to enjoye her We have <had>* ice in Calw these two days plants and trees look sadly down, happily that the appels trees are not yet in bloosom.

Some years ago you said why has God done it now we speak other wise and give Him right - humbling our selves for us and mankind who are so unbelieving I am glad for you that you have not the responsability of an own situation, if we have to live humbly quietly it is sufficient, the less we mix with the world the best, You live to Your Lord serve Him humbly joyfully till we shall see Him appearing

Adieu my sweet son I wish you peace and joy in the Lord,

 With a kiss
 Yours JG.
