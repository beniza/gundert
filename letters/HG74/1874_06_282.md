My dear Children <Sam>*

Though we had many peopel from India I have not heard a word about you, when Stolz was here with Wengert I was in Wildbad and when Muller came he was so very tired that he went to bed half an hour after his arival in order to leave here at 10 the evening to go to Nagold with papa, however he felt so weak and tired that he remained in bed till next morning then went to Bale. he looks weak and miserabel, Lauffer who was here too seems to be the same as of old, he is cured it appears of his old complaint, and speaks of returning to India leaving 8 children here, taking the youngest with them

I have been three weeks in Wildbad with Uranie she injoyd it, it seems that it has done her good, I am glad to be again at home. This week we are alone Uranie myself and the servant girl, papa and Hesse in Bale Jettle in Heidelberg Marie with her children is here too; but they have their house hold for themselves, the boys are growing, going to school so that one hears less of them or of noise, I have just heard a good preaching of Helfer Grill, This morning I read in Steinhofer some thing on prayer after I had just been thinking how difficult it is to watch and pray. inspite of so many exortations to pray without ceasing, to be watchful un* to prayer. Sthofer gives the exemple of Jesus getting up early to pray among other things he says "Manchmal sind wir ganz nahe an der Salbung der göttlichen Kraft, die wir erlangen solten, und wir halten uns nur nicht als leere gefässe so lange hin; bis wir gefüllet sind. Daher haben wir das wahrzunehmen, dass wenn wir uns gleichsam zum gebet wollen gürten, wir bedenken, das Jesus in allem anliegen gebetet habe, dass er die ganze nacht darinnen angehalten

Wer einmal ans herz Jesu so gewöhnt ist, dass er alle seine besonderen Umstände mit Him ausmachen can, in der einsamkeit mit gebet und flehen, und so lange darinn anhält, bis er weiss, was sein wohlgefälliger Sinn darinnen ist, und nun dasselbe in seiner gemeinschaft ausrichten und behandeln can, so ists gethan, wie es gethan seyn sollte, wie es dem fater gefällt. 
After the Bibel I find nothing like Steinho works specially on Römer and on the Epistel of John.

With us it rains much, and though it is not very warm things grow rapidly 
With a hearty kiss to each of you and love to all those who remember us I remain yours affly
 Julie G.

Much love from Uranie
