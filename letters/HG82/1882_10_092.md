An Herrn D Gundert, 6 Hohe Straße in Stuttgart
 <9 Okt 82>1
Lieber D[avid]

We have a serious business before us. On Wednesday 9 1/2 AM I hope to arrive at St with dear G Pfleid from Basle (now here) and Schauffler and we shall try to settle something before the British Charg‚ d'Affaires (name unknown). It is about the ground at Chovva which Heb bought and we (the Mission) have to defend our rights agst the Raja of Chiracal. Now 1. question. Could you not go to Col. Sweet and ask him if he would have the kindness to accompany us to the Legation (if known there? or able to come) to identify me and perhaps Schauffler (Pfleid he does not know by face, but Pfl has a brother, Steuerverwalter at St.) 2. Would you - perhaps accompanied by Col. Sw. ask at the legation, at what hour we could come (10 or 11 AM.?) to have our affidavits signed and sealed etc before the big man. Try to set about it sharp
 Goodbye Your F.

Herzlichen Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag. Theodors sollen nur kommen! 
Von Herm ein Brief, fortgehende Besserung; aber sein Schwiegervater ist plötzlich gestorben.
