Dear Julie

We arrived yesterday 1.30 happily at Bale Adis Memerl and Marulla were … la gare, and Paul Hoch came with his commission. Half an hour afterwds we two went to the other side of the Rhine, when I got Ur off to Burgdf II cl. in good company. I hope she will have arrived with Louise about 5.14. When I came near the Müllerweg Adis danced out to meet me and she has been constantly about me to tell me all her secrets of school, house and friends. Joh will return Mond. evening. Herm has already visited Reinh's Kolb's and other people, the singing at Church seemed to him particularly fine. There is today also a singing feast, 600 songsters are to meet in the Münster. But the music he best liked came from the Amer. letter, all well over there. Goodbye!


2Liebe Mama und Geschwister, auch von mir herzlichen Kuß. Habe gut geschlafen und freue mich mit Marie und den Kindern, die ich nach so häufigen Beschreibungen in die Ferne nun leibhaftig genieße.


3Many many kisses, dear Mamma, I am so glad and happy to have our dear guests. I hope you can rest. All the children send kisses.
