My dear Marie

Many thanks for your good kind letter, I was glad to hear from you and see that you are all well.

It has pleased the Lord to preserve my life in this last attaque and I feel better than I could have expected; still I feel weak in the head and the legs, these two days of cleaning I could scarsly go up and doun as I would have liked, for the last time we had Stamheim christine, she goes to Stutgart in the Magteanstalt were Mrs Sheffel wish to have her. Our Christine is unwell since several weeks, she can just cook, one spares her as much as possible.

Now dearest Marie I write on account of Uranie, I am sorry she comes to you when your Children are there, but it cannot be helped. Saturday Frederic is to fetche her in Cormondresh from Stgalle where he has work, but suppose his work would make him impossible to go to Cormondresh, he would pray John to go fetch Uranie to be with you on Sunday 24 and come back with Frederic on Monday, from StGalle he will write to you in case he could not go till Cormondresh, he hopes to be able to go; but it is better I think you have an idia that perhaps he can not go in which case John would be so kind to fetch her, At all event Frederic will write if it was necessary. 
It is already so cold that we have fire in the oven. I am glad to hear that Carl gives you joy; may it be so also with Theo

much love to them all
 Yours affectionate
 J. G.
