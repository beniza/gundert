Lieber H.

Today Jette Isbg told me, Mr Debt on meeting her in the street has informed her that Karls dismissal from Prussia has arrived with him, but that she must now apply etc The Prussian preferred it seems to send the paper gratis, from office to office. I wondered a long time why nothing came! - David is here with his Winie, who has a lively recollection of aunt Unania or Uanina. - Soga I send you. Dav. hat Deine 2 nicht abgeschickt, sie kommen mit Nro 3. But Duff I have not, was satisfied with Lal Behari's reminiscences, chiefly because I heard from Yg that he was not overmuch liked at Edinb, being famous for laying down the law. We also had some thunder and rain One day I was without fire, today it burns again. - Ja die Dorfgem. is taken out of the Chin Recorder But she may well be treated once more adding an inquiry into the causes of things. In Kind.bl. I have now the story of Pierce in Guaiana. Zahn pretty well today, his child in hot fever. Mar Gdt in Herrenalb very unquiet by night. Goodbye
