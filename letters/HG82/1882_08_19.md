An Frau Dr Gundert in Calw WÃ¼rtemberg

 19/8 821

I would only tell you that I passed a pretty good night and have my 2d cl. trip behind me. As far as Reichenbach I went with Mrs. Wulfius of Dorpat and her son, who saw much of Mrs Staatsrath Neue. In something like 6 hours I hope to be at Bautzen where Mr G. is to meet me

 Goodbye
 Yours H
