My dearest Marie

We were happy and thankful to God for the safe delivry He has given you. May He keep and bless mother and child, and give you much joy and peace. Many thanks for your kind letter of the 10th. As for the seed of spinard it has not been forgotten; but one can only sow it in spring in march with the other seed, carots, spinard etc. Uranie thought to bring you some plants of it to put it in your garden: but it was so dry than that one gave up the idia to transplant it.

Dear Herman is terribly cast down; he has not slept at all the last night he is so very much driven about in his mind. I hope that the quiet time on board may do him good. The Lord alone can help him. Had I not been as he is I would feel greatly distressed about his state

Adieu my dear Child. Yours affectionate
 J. G.
