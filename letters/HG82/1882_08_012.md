 Calw first August <1882>*
Dear Marie

This morning we were rejoiced to have from your own hand such good account of you all, and thank God that Johne <Hansle>* is such sweet Child, gentle, and good at night. We hope that Herman shall love and respect him as he did his Marula when she was a baby.

You will be glad to have your Adelle again, she has spent most of her time in Steinhause, every afternoon and often forenoons Emma has been exceedingly kind to her. Emma Plebst being there who took them when the weather permitted in the forest; they have spent their time joyfully and happy. 
Hannele and Marie are away since three weeks.

Stamheim Christine is to go in Stutgart Mrs Sheffel wish to have her in the Anstalt, for the hard work to show the girls to wash as they wash for peopel, and cook also for many young ladies. filles de boutique etc. so Christine shall have plenty of work. there is a kook but to help her wash and clean, is still much to do. Poor Christine is not quite sure if it is her calling. we shall regrete her. the three last days she has been with us to clean the comptoir during the absence of Frederic.

I hope that you shall have a blessed time with papa

With much love to you all and kisses
 Yours affectionate
 J. G.

I beg pardon that fat spots came on the paper I just came from the Cookroom where Bacon had been made in Ghee, and we ate of the grabons
