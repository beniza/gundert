My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last of the 30th Aug recieved today; till now the Lord has helped sustained your hopes Your illness is not of those which pass quickly it takes time and patience; but in the same measure you understand your Lord and live with Him observing His doing and thanking, the health and chearfulness returne,

That you make yourself reproches for the time you were here is a mark of the illness. had I not experienced the same formerly I would not speak so boldely to you. how long have I suffered with continuel reproches, thinking that I was but a burden and no one could be so bad and unworthy as myself etc. no end of accusation, till at last I could say well it is all true I am such one but others bear with me God bears and has patience with me; what will I, it is no humility it is a rest of selfrightiousness with which the devil troubels me as if it was a bit of repentance, necessary to me At last the Lord gave me grace to count all these sins and mistakes with the real great sin of unbelief and lay all at my Saviours feet. His blood cleans from all sin, that word became so precious to me that I cannot live without it. the blood of Jesus that is my dress and rightiousness since that the Epistel of John are my delight We have an advocate before the father, for every mistakes for every faults and shortcoming Come to the precious blood of the lamb there alone is peace and joy to be got. 
Avoid dear son all that which excites in drinking and eating, have patience and give thanks, the Lord will do you much good and to your dear ones injoye the air as much as possible; but all come from the Lord As soon as your nerves get quieter the appetite will return, drink milk and eat eggs no sour thing

that your visit has given us great joy and caused thanks to God I need not to repeat, Let the dear Lord be much more to us than any one in the world 
with much love to you all
 Yours affect
 J. G.
