Lieber D.

Von Brem. kam noch eine Postkarte. H war mit Joh. Walter zusammen getroffen, once Paul's client and nephew of Kemmler, going to Baltimore. H schlief 1 1/2 hours, what we are to tell you to quiet your heart and went about 6 AM to Bremhaven. - Mama has no fear about Agn. etc. So you may come on Saturday. On Sunday I go to Bulach for a Miss.feast, but Mama stays at home. The papers for Children's leaves will be ready I hope for you to take along. The time is not very favorable to such work. The brother of Adis will be glad to leave for St he complains that here it is so longwhily. Little John seems to be a strong boy; but criard so that Mar finds it difficult to get the necessary rest.

 With our love
