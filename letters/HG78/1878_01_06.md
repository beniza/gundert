My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your last recieved already a fourtnight ago, how glad we would have been to spend these feast days together with you; we shall have I suppose no more meeting in this world, but we look for the great meeting with our Lord when He shall be all in all, then we shall live of reallity, here it is but a mixture of truth and untruth how beautiful when light and reallity shall not be mixed when we shall poscesse that which we would like to have now continually; but which passes like a lightning I mean hear Gods voice, have communion with Him, see Him alone in all things! 
Our peopel are in Kornthal so Uranie and myself injoy rest today, we have paid a visit in Steinhouse where all are well. I have seen Grandmama who has a good deal of pain, she asked after you all and sends much love as well as tante R.

Bardts Annele is in bed, since nearly two years she is very poorly, often in bed or on the saufa and poor. Old Catherine 82 years old has to cook and care, this evening came old Bardt sighing for pain he was in the mission stunde and fell down, hurt his shoulder very much, one has to put wet clothes the all night so one is going to put him in the hospital as one cannot care for him here, poor old Catherine is really to be pittied, she is a good woman weeps often in saing Annele always ill,

In Stutgart I have seen Davids Magasin, it is a good thing that it is near our peopel where George Plebst can give good words and advises besides help, Uranie sends you much love she is pretty well, How much one would like to see your Emmale and her sisters, we shall soon hear about your Christmastree and presents the little one will have made big eyes as did the babies here

With a good kiss to my very dear Tine and each of you
 Yours aff JG.
