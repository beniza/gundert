My dear Children [Hermann]

Many thanks for your two last letters. It was indeed time for dear Tine to get a better house I joy with her in her new and comfortable home, So you had a nice evening by the singers who brought their supper with them, it was then the first time? I am glad for dear Julia that she got encoragement for her trouble in teaching sinning.

I am reading with much pleasure the new Harmoney of the Gospel by papa, it is of a great adventage to understand by having the history of the four Evangelist in one, how much more clearer, and the remarks about the subject, I do not understand every thing, first the print is small and in an order unusual, so I have some troubel for the begining, how ever I like it so much that I shall persevere and shall have and have already many blessing by this work

Uranie is in Wildbad with a friend of her, I am glad I could remain at home, We have to clean again having the house white washed outside. We have much rain and rather cold, but on the filds things grow so quick that the paysents say they never sow any thing like it, a wonderful year plenty of every thing, With much love to every one

 with a kiss yours JG.
