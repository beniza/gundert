My dear Children [Hermann]

Yesterday <7. MÃ¤rz>* we had again a good letter <No. 235>* from you; the one before expressed some discouragement and no wonder, the wonder is the patience you have had hiether too. May the Lord lead and guide you showing you where you are to labour, may it not be in Europe once? These as other plans and wishes we put before our Lord who will arrange all things for the best. How wonderfully has He done regarding Frederic and David, more than we would ever have expected; how happy are we to have recieved faith precious gift of God which we do not value enough. I hope my dear Tine has a good winter, her hands well, and no anxieties about your dear three girls; is Marle quite well again? and if you should leave your new house they would all follow papa in an other place in America or where he shall have to go.

Much love from Uranie and from Mama with a hearty kiss
