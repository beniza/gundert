Dear children [Hermann]

I have two letters of yours without having written a line, first of all, many thanks for the kindness you have to write to me separately inspite of much work which occupy your time fully. I know and feel that you understand me in my small complaints and that you pray, for my dear Sister I can pray that God would open her eyes to know herself, to know the long patience of our Lord. If the forgiveness of our sins produces but little thanks, the ungreatfulness is felt in every thing, If I am consious of the great love of Jesus in pardoning me all my sins, I shall be contented of all His doing with me, more or less health, comfort or discomfort, injoiement or privation; but Elas it takes a long time till we be contented with all things and say in some measure after Paul I can do all things with my Lords grace, When little children are unwell they are cross and displeased with those around them, such is still my sister, without knowing it, Jesus can alone change that and make her happy and joyful the peace of Jesus which passes all understanding filling the heart keep the mind, then there is always thanks and gratitude. I feel I want more love and patience, and am sure God will give it me so that I may have a good conscience. Papa is exceedingly good and kind speaking always frensh having twice a Bibel explanation in the week just for Uranie sake all these complaints are for you alone here no one knows them

With a tender kiss to each of you
 Yours affectly JG
