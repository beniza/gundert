My dear Children [Hermann]

Your last has again rejoiced me much, so our Lord is gracious and faithful. He has given you a fine season of refreshement, with His presence, such times are surely the hapiest, and we feel we can pray with faith and experience in some measure with John that we have the petitions which we bring before Him. We know pretty well when we pray with faith we have our petitions, while at other times we try to pray. and form some sentenses of prayers, and after all with sighing we cry to God for His spirit who prays according to the will of God, and John tells us which sort of petitions we are to bring regarding others who grieve us by their walk,

This morning we had with papa the first of Peter second Epistel, it had struck me before, that Peter speaks often of knowlege, the word of God be more searched to get understanding and knowlege, I had not understood the word virtue which we are to add to faith, it means power abiliti to resiste to fight, to be manly. Oh if only I could put to execution the many instructions and blessings I have from God partly through papa, but I have to sigh and morn often because of my idelness, negligence, my heart condamnes me for being so utterly backward to confes Him, and speak of His love. formerly it was much more easy for me to do it, now I will rather injoye than to serve, and after all perhaps become lukeworm,

Maries children have just been here their papa is unwell with diarrehe and headach, so Mama cannot visit us. Your dear Children begin to rejoice of Christmas I suppose and Mama is soon going to make goodle

David has come to spend the sunday papa is not quite well

With much love to each of you
 Yours afftly JG.
