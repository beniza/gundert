My dear Children [Samuel]

The day before yesterday came your kind letter, the day before it the carry stuff had come to my astonishement. I could not imagine from where it came, Our successors are provided for their life time with it I thank you for them. You annonce also tea for which many thanks duty we shall of cource gladly pay as I have paid for the curry stuff

I shall try to get heidelbeer, my last bag I gave to Maries husband who wants a great deal I hope one shall get this year and I shall have much pleasure to send you some,

I have been long looking for a small note from you dearest Elisabeth; but I understand that you have no time, The time spent on the Hills will have strengthened you I trust and the dear Herrman too, he had red cheeks we heard, and how graciously the Lord has preserved you on your return. The out side of our house is to be white washed and one has pulled down the old chunam which has produced such terrible dust that my eyes are paining today. we shall have probably during some weeks the noise going on. 
I know very little of your dear mother. Peregrina with Caroline were here, I think your Mama and Jetthen have hard with those two personnes, I really pitty them, poor Mama has no good old days We were much grieved to hear of Mr Hallers death.

Now my dear accept a kiss for you and yours specially for baby from your affectionate
 JG.
