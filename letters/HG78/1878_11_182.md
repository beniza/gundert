My dear Children [Hermann]

The good warm kiss of dear Emmale has reached us safely and has been recieved with great joy. I send her one too as hearty I trust as hers was. also to dearest Tine and your two dear daughters of whom we like always to hear much.

Today I feel very tired having had much to do the last days, preparing the things for Nelli <Stoton>* who went away today, She had become so negligent that all her things had to be mended, We thank God for having opened a door for them both, perhaps they will learn better than they did with us, the eldest is a sad caractere, untrue and proud.

We are glad for you in this winter to think you have more room and more comfortable. May the Lord give you joy in the congregation in which you work so patiently

Adieu dear Son with love from Uranie to you all and from
 Yours aff JG.
