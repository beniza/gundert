Accompanied by Müller newly returned ...2 and Mercara I passed from Carlsr to B...2 then alone to Delsbg. In the morng till ...2der. Ur. received me and said that Fred. h...2 morng for Chateau d'Oeux, J had an attack of ...2 Choleralike at Corc. Thursd, she managed ...2 to N. but felt already that farther travellg was out of question. Even today though all is much better there is no possibility of leavg the house. She rests on the sofa, is very quiet and awaits the decision from me. Before tomorrow Mond we certainly cannot travel and when we do it, we must divide the task carefully <she says no - go in one hurry>. But why speak of what is future! She is thankful for a very good night. Goodbye. Love to all
