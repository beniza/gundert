My dear Children [Hermann]

It is already long since I wrote you; but I have been always rejoiced to hear about you all, your children giving you joy. We see with gratitude the time coming when papa shall be able to breathe more at liberty that great and important work being soon ended if mine eyes would permit me I would begin the Bibel but it is small print and I can read; but little at a time, however the Bibel meetings which papa has in frensh for Uranie recompense fully for the privation of being unable to read. I have learnd more since Uranie is here through papa than I ever did before.

The Lord has honored our dear friend Marie Kaiser who has served Him in the poor and sick constantly she had gone to stamheim were her brother is minister. after some days spent there to help for the mariage of her niece she was on the point to return home to spend the sunday here with the poor and sick as she was taking farewel, her sister in law said you are not looking well, she replied I feel headache, she sat on the sauffa suddenly got a strock of apopleccy and died a few hours afterward Is it not beautiful the Lord has not let her see death, She is greatly regretted, she was intirely devoted to the service of God. When I think of her love and faithfulness I feel greatly ashamed.

Uranie sends you love and myself with a tender kiss to each of you 5 I remain
 yours affectly JG.
