My dear Children [Hermann]

It is to thanks our dear Julia that I take up my pen this time, her letter has given us so much joye, Tante Uranie who is in Wildbad will I am sure be very glad to get so a warm grus from her, May the blessings which she has recieved during the instruction remain her all life, she is already a help to papa and Mama which is to say much.

David has just left us he came this morning <Pfingstmontag>*, Anna Gundert who has spent 10 days in Calw has gone back with him, I pity her for she is not yet well not sound in mind, she is a heavy burden on Adolph; but he might also care more for her or have more pity with her for she is ill in her mind, Adelle Hesse has been very ill with scarlat fever, now she has less fever and eats with appetite. Herman is a fine fellow a real good boy I am just reading the suffring of the Lord in the Harmony of the gospel by papa, it is most beautiful, nothing like it, you will value it. I am very thankful to read it I read it for the second time.

With a tender kiss to every one of you specially my dear Tine  Yours affectin J.G.
