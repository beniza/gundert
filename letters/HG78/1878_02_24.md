My dear Children [Hermann]

In seing Mr Katz who came from Brasilla (who he is papa will surly tell you) I felt how many thanks we ought to God to have preserved each of you children from such an illness, and what are we better? no surly it is pure grace, O for how much have we to thank to be well in soul, body and spirit, how ungratefull do I feel, how great is the patience and long suffring of the Lord. Poor Deushle lies in bed with gleader Weh he has such pain that now and then he fancys one will have to cut off one leg, which of course is not the case; but there he lies, no one to work to keep the family, and how many others are in troubel; are we better than them? no, we are spared by the mercis of our Lord, it is grace; So it is with temptation He does not allow the devil to go too far in troubling is. We feel well that he is like a roaring lion about us, and seeks to devour us; but He who has overcome keeps us to fight and overcome with His power, One night I was like in hell troubled with cares intirely unable to get rid of them. I than felt how much pity one should have for troubled souls, the faith to transport mountains is not recongnised enough that precious gift of God how often have we not with out percieving it transported mountains by faith, If we are left alone in the temptation and without faith we then learn to know the value of faith, and the value of the words repeated in the mind of Jesus "lead us not in temptation You have still troubel with your peopel who can not and will not pay for the building I can understand that it is painful for you and wish that you may soon be at rest, and that those stingy peopel may find Jesus who is better than money, and to my dear Tine I wish peace and joy with her daughters to whom and to you I send a good kiss  Yours J. G.
