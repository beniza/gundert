Dear Children [Hermann]

It is a long time since I wrote to you, not since I was in Corcelles with Uranie where we saw Frederic and his wife, now they are leaving for Paris from where they will take there* places to return to America as soon as possible the life of traveling does not agree with Frederic he is really very poorly and suffers a good deal from indigestion, Francis is going back too with Lucy. We had real joy with Frederic. I am glad to have seen him once more, it may be the last in this world. Uranie saw her old friends and returned gladely to Calw where she seams to be happy, Since she came from Wildbad she has been much better walks without pain and is chearful. David or Frederic will or have written to you I suppose about their journey in England, they are both very busy perhaps too much; however I trust they do not neglect their souls, the Lord has means to keep us in His path, Frederic cannot write having crampes in the right hand, it is sad for him who has much to write; but the Lord speaks in many ways he is very nice, we have joy together, Marie has been rather unwell since her confinement, much pains on her face in the bones round the eyes; now more in the teeth, through the illness of Adele she had been too tired and became very weak so that now she wants time to recover, we have been somewhat anxious on account of the pains in her face, the little Paul though born three weeks before the time is well, sleeps and drinks some of the mothers milk and cows milk too, he has a good appetite Hermanle cannot walk as yet so that there is much to do, Adele is well; but still weak and cross, very excitable and nervous Carl is inchanted of a little brother he said we want still tweens and all shall be right, to be many children that is nice; but Theodor said then we shall be very poor!

Dear Tine has been cheated by a rogue it was good it was not more I send her and to the dear three girls very hearty kisses with much love  Yours affly
 love from Uranie Yours JG
