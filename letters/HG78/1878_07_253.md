My dear Children [Samuel]

It is to thank you that I write these few lines for the tea which you have kindly sent through Mrs Isenberg. I wrote her to thank and asked what I owe her for porto and Custome house since I have not heard.

These last weeks I have been drying blackberreys or Heidelbeer which shall be sent by the next opportunity to India,

By your letters we are glad to hear good accounts of you all and rejoice with you of the dear Hermanle who is growing to your joy.

Since Maries confinement of her Paul, she has not been well, much pain on her face, in the bones round the eyes so that we were anxious these two last days the pain is more in the teeth so we hope it will at last leave her, She will not be able to continue to nurse she is too weak, the little boy is well, though smaller than the others were as he came in the world <somewhat too early.>*. The long illness of Adele has pulled her down so much that Paul was born 3 weeks before the time I have recieved a nice letter from Mrs. Diez about her large family. She expresses also a longing after a time of refreshement, after more life, she has read Hebich life which made her to see how different it is now with that blessed time we had to witness.

Since I was ill my hand trembels more than formerly and I feel still weak, so I will say Adieu with much love from yours affectly
 JG.
