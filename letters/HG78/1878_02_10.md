1My dear Children [Hermann]

It is already some weeks I have not written you a line. We were amused to hear that Emmale knew so well to avoid to hear about having been punished, I could well feel for dear Tine her grieved spirit for having administered to her pet that which the dog had fully deserved. I wonder at Tine's patience with the little unclean beast, we had once a cat in that way which David called Himmlishwesen he did not allow me to flog the cat for uncleanness, not even when it came upon himself as he carried the cat about, once he weapt bitterly as he saw me beating the Himlishe Wesen, he never forgave me I think to have at last sent away the cat, Dear David he comes now and then to see us he gives us joy he is nice, he has much to do, as well as Frederic who has often to go to Stutgart every week once or twice God has been good to bring them near for papa

With hearty love to each of you with kisses
 Yours affectly

love from Uranie
