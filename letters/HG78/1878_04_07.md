My dear Children [Hermann]

Again a good letter from you, that which you say about being under a cloud has interested me, not that I like it for you, but as I am myself some time under a cloud and just now. I felt the truth of that, that the sun exists behind the clouds and though no reys of it should be percieved nevertheless it exists, so is the love of Jesus and His light, I am now and then so melancholy, so nervous that I fear to become mad; but the Lord helps again and again, sending His sun sustaining faith, but I feel that I can bear no fatigue, my nerves are very weak, if I force a little my senses as well as the body cannot bear it, good that I am not forced or obliged to fatigue. 
You had too much to do and to bear these last times; I am very glad to hear that your dear wife is a good help to you in troubels and keep faith the only remedy. May the peace of Jesus keep your hearts and minds in Christ. 
I send a good kiss to you all and best wishes for dear Julias confirmation. we would like to see her and give her some what for her confirmation 
Adieu to all
 yours affectio JG.
