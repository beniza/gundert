My dear Children [Hermann]

When I wrote last time I told you that papa was very unwell, now he is thank God better. We are growing old we feel it; but are happy and thankful, Have you heard that the old <83 jÃ¤hr>* Catherine <gestorben 6. Aug>* of Dr Bardt has died after a short illness, since that Annele has much heimweh after her, I told her it would be better to have such longing after the Lord than after Catherine, I trust it may come to this, she is very poorly since several years, and can scarsly care for her small house; so the difficulty is to get someone with her with whom she passes or agrees to find a simple and upright soul is a rare thing, for such one to live single or with some one is not such great matter to be einfeltig and not viel manifeltig is a rarity, Oh for truth and singlness, which keep us from much misery and unhappiness; Thank God for having a simpel, true wife it is a treasure I meet seldome true peopel. I hope your dear children are true and upright, With a kiss to each of you 5 I remain
 Yours affectionally J Gundert
