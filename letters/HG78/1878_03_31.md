My dear Children [Hermann]

We have snow and sun, Yesterday 30th of March we were in the garden it was a fine day. I have put onions and peas in the ground and sown some seeds, We had also our forwindows taken away, some what sooner than usual because they were very dirty and are very difficult to be cleansed, so to avoid to clean them once more one took them away, it was a tiresome day. so that today I have to keep quiet else my legs will not go I wonder what you are doing, Tine in the garden with her dear daughters or leaving it for some one else, it would be I suppose a little hard to quit the commodious house for others. To morrow perhaps a letter may tell us something about your plans. The Lord will lead you to do His will. Since some time Uranie is much better, she felt that the enemy had had power over her, We are both very thankful to papa for giving us every week two hours in frensh reading the Bibel.

I hope my dearest Tine with her Children are well I send them as well as to your self a hearty kiss,

 Yours affectionate
 JG.
