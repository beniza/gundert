My dear Children [Hermann]

I am really ashamed to wait so long before writing a word about dear Julias confirmation. I thought more of her to day as Carl Schoffel in our house has been confirmed today, the house is full of peopel, all relations; you will have had a quiet time, more to do with God than with men, such seasons are much troubled and spoiled by outward things

I think Hebich and Barth were not wrong to speak against those feasts of eating and dressing. If a servant of Christ does not speak against such abuses who shall speak and give light, many may be convinced of the evil of it if they hear, Paul said. "Be not comformed to the world, by what are we to begin not to be fashioned like the world? Children of God are to be on their guarde every day more, so as to be the light of the world and not like it. I hope that dear Julia seeks above all the love of her Lord knowing that the love of the world is enemity against God and we cannot serve two masters. I send her a hearty kiss and to each of you specially Mama 
 yours affectionate JG.

love from Uranie
