My dear Children [Samuel]

Though I have not heard from you since a long time, I will however send a word of love in these last days of the year 77 in wishing you happy days, Samuels letter and yours give us joy in hearing how your Hermanle grows and gives you such pleasure, I can understand how painful it will have been for you when he had the croop; or any other complaint; but through the many trials which are sent us we learn to pray and to believe. He loves us more than we do our own children, could we believe that how confident how childlike would we be, love would drive away all fears, how happy we would be if there were no fear more in us specially in illness or tribulation, how often are we still uneasy through fears, while the peace of Jesus which passes all understanding might keep us in perfect quietness amidst all troubels. That which I wish you and myself for this new year is that love which drives away all fear. His love to us can work this, to His praise, Please give my love to all who remember us

With best wishes and kisses to dear baby and yourselves I remain yours affectly
 JG.
much love from my sister
