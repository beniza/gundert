as to old Indian friends who may be in or about London I recommend my two sons Frederick and David Gundert who are about paying a visit to England, being associated with me in my work, for any services their kindness may prompt them to show to younger pilgrims on the same road which the fathers trod.

With Christian regards
 Yours very truly
