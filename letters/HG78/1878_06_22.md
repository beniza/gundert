Dear papa

from the Hotel de commerce I write quickly a few words, that you may know that we have arrived safe, We have spent the night at Berton <Burgdorf>* where we were recieved with much love, their fine house and all the beauties I shall relate when together, meawhile much love.

At 4 Oc we arrived here where Frederic and Mary recieved us in the train, we remain here to morrow, Monday we shall DV go to Corcelles and Cormondrech remain there three days, than one here the last with our people here which would be thursday and please God back in one day Friday, As Uranie will partout return with me,

Our journey has been on the whole good, in Singen only hapened a little avanture which I shall relate later; but the Lord has been gracious to us and spared us trouble, without the assistence of Mrs. Hess who from Chafause went through Zurich, we came again together in Arau, one takes usually that road which is not shorter but more pleasant. Frederic has got a golden watch for you from Francois

I know dear papa that you allow me to remain till Friday on account of Uranie who will not remain to wait for dear John, We shall be very glad to get good news about you all. I hope that dear Marie s children have been spared of the illness.

With hearty love from Uranie Frederic and Mary to each of you  Yours affectly
 J. Gundert
