An Herrn F Gundert in Calw

 <24 Mai 84.>*

Saturday 2 PM. I write this at Bruchsal Fancy I was told at Frankft that I could not get to Mlbr before 7 PM, so intended to go by slow train. But then I discovered the Kopps from Afr who came from Hambg and went to Basle, and in order to accompany them, took express to Heidelbg. When arrived there I found by the Würtbg (old) plan that in going to Mühlacker and returning I c[oul]d gain some hours. Came to Br.<uchsal>* and found that I c[oul]d take a ticket to Mlbr expr. where I shall be within an hour. DV. goodbye
