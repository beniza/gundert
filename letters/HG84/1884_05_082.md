 Calw 8th Mai 1884
My dear Marie

A few lines only to thank through you dear Jettle for her kind letters I was very glad to hear so much about you all and Uranie I have written her a few days ago in sending her a letter from America. Catherine has been in Calw 7 days she has lodged with Christine Dirlam, has been twice with us. she is now in Altsteig and comes again next week, she has become very thin, but is pretty well.

About Luise Zahn I have heard from several personnes that she has tried to be reconsiled with mother already some months ago; but the last recieved the desire of L with a smile of moquery without hearing farther, A paques L. sent her a cake with ten Mrks to help her to pay her lodging, Jettle will be glad to hear this as well as yourselves.

With us all is going on as usual, David writes, his Paul has two teeth and sleeps well in spite of a cold and many boils. Elisabeth has pretty much trouble with her English girl she is not clean as yet her bed and drowrs are to be washed now and then

I was glad to hear that Adelle is already such a help to you, Marula nice as ever, If the Lord permit that I can go to Bale with Papa I shall be glad to see you all, specially Herman who is grown up so much. My leg being better I hope to go to the meeting this evening.

Not to weary my eyes and arm I say Adieu.

Much love to dear John and each of you. Jettle ist still with you  Yours affectly J Gundert
