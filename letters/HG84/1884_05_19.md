Dear Freddy,

It is 7 1/2 AM and I have just arrived at Mr Joh. Tidemanns, therefore give notice that the night has had some sleep. Yesterday evening a storm took place and the lightning kindled a house near the railroad. I did not see it, but others afterwards told of it. Plenty love to all. I do not now write any more in a hurry till I have seen Johnny and Theod. Good morning also to the little ones from
 Yr affte F.
