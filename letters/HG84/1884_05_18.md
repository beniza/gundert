An Herrn F Gundert in Calw, WÃ¼rtemberg

 Fkft <18 Mai 84.>*

6 PM So far well arrived here. With one of the emigrants, a good woman from Liebelsbg I could talk somewhat, she being glad to find one whom she knew a little Gzlr had encouraged her to go to her son in Amer. Daughters and others went along. I left them at Durl. and had nice company to Fkft. A return ticket was only to be got here (for 8 days), at Heidelbg they had one for Hambg but not to Br. Now I wish you a good day, plenty love to Ma and all around you. The day was magnificent and my hope for a quiet night pretty strong, no fatigue as yet.
 Ever yr affte F.
