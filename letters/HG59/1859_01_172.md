Dear Papa

At last your letter from Telli came with one of Mr Fritz, to Convert by which we see what the conferance has decreed about the Sauvains and schools!

So you went much slower than we expected and perhaps in the same way are you going to Mangalore; but I trust it does you good to be at sea. A letter returned from Telichery addressed to the Editor of the Malabar Magazine came no one knows any thing here about it I will send it you by the next written papers. As you may perhaps help the Amboo who wrote it, he has also put a stamp to pay the answer to his note.

the Ship came yesterday and left again this morning. We paid our last visit to Mrs Glasson. He is not well some what troubled with diarhee. Mrs Maclin whom we saw too is buying much from Howkers else no sign of life nor much learning. There came a large Home letter from Fritz and one for Conv nothing for us, except it be in Fs one. In your next tell us how he is for he was very poorly at Telli, I hear.

We go on well with sister Moerike Marie sends you a heap of letters for the children. Here all as usual I felt rather weak and tired these days and am glad not to have too many people Mrs M is as quiet as* satisfied of <with> any thing.

Love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
