My precious Frederic

Your last letter pleased me well, and I trust you will continue to write often. You see that I am in the place where you were with papa when you were so poorly. Mrs Irion who was also here at the time related me yesterday, how displeased and angry you were because you did not get meat nor rice nor milk according to your want and so did too Christian and Carles. Sweet child; times have changed happily. I like this place very well; though I feel the cold terribly and often trambles from cold because just now it rains and there is not often sun shine, when it does shine I expose myself to its rays to get worm. In coming up the way of Sisapara I walked some time and the leeches without regard for my shoes and stockings pricked me, as I had just some boils on one of my arm, I took them from my legs and put them on the boils more than one dozen of them, that did me much good, now all the boils have gone and I feel better than when at Calicut. 
Adieu my precious sweet son
 With a kiss
 Your Mama
