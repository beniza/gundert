My sweet Paul

Yesterday I heard that your leg was not yet well and are obliged still to keep the bed: I trust you learn also a lesson in the bed I mean a lesson from the Lord, perhaps patience, obedience! Grown up people they have to learn obedience to the Lord and children are commanded to be be obedient to their parents or to those who stand instead of them and those children who are most obedient to parents are more happy and can afterward be more obedient to God, Some, even many people and children imagine, that, if they were placed differantly, had other parents they could do every thing so nicely so easily; but it is all deception. I still remember when I thought if my parents were rich could make me to learn instead of working how happy how good would I be I envied all the children who could go learn the whole year who were dressed better than me. I dare say that my dear boys who have plenty time and good opportunity to learn fancy that to do some thing else would be the thing to make them happy and they could be so obedient is it not? Oh dear boys how foolish we are till the dear Lord becomes our portion our wisdome. Do you also pray indeed to Him do you believe that He hears you and loves you Paul Gundert whose leg keeps you in bed. Jesus has been standing by your bed and often called you Paul give me thine heart, did you hear Him.

 Adieu my dear child
 your Mama J.G.
