Dear Papa

I suppose you are at Tellichery and enjoe a good day together. I hope the Lord has opened a door to Capt Taylor in Brennen I shall be glad to hear all about it. Was Mrs. I able to bear the fatigue of the large party? What has been settled about the poor Sauvains?

Mr Pfleidere's account has just come I send it to you as written paper with the other parcels. Make an end with that Bull I beg either sell it or bring it back.

Mrs. Glasson paid us a visit with Mrs. Macklin. no news. the ship not yet arrived, Mr. Grant came to see Capt Taylor, and said he had been told that he would not leave this before Saturday eve. Give love and thanks to dear Sophie for her kind letter. love also to the other sister. Thanks to Mr. Plebst for jelly he did send us by you when you came from the hills I hear now from Sister M. How is he? and what about Hunziker Mrs Amman very poorly they say, inquire please from him!

Here all as usual. All the letters and papers which came for you are in the bundle sent along with this.

With love to all
 Yours J. G

Tell me also how you feel and are?



1My own dear papa!

I wonder where and how you are just in this moment, but I hope you are pretty well and have got over the fatigue you had on your last evening here.
