Dr. H. Gundert, Mission house

 <17 Jan 59>*
Dear Papa

Mr. G<rant>* came back this morning early, I had almost a fit of running off. As I did in the Colo Thompon's house; but remembering my foolishness I stop quiet waiting to get down with him in his Vandy; now they are so kind that they say I must stay a few days longer. They wish you to dine here one day either this evening or tomorrow; it may be he feels too tired this evening as he traveled the whole night. He will bring you up in his Carriage. Imagine that she told me last night that when they heard of your being ill at Mangalore and of the possibility of your going home and of my perhaps being obliged to go too they would keep Marie who might go down every day if wanted: and return here. They told it to each other as if the thought had occured to both alike

He told her that little horse bandy of mine would take her down and up in no time!

Love to Marie
 Yours J. Gundert
