My dear wife

This morning comes your letter? no - only the money papers. I return them at once with receipt. Please to send Abraham Kidaon* with them as he is mentioned on the back. Then pay Convert 110 Rs (cent dix -) for Fritz and keep the rest till my return.

Theophil Hoch is very poorly, not exactly sick, but no life about him It is quite sad to see him thus, the parents are very calm in the Lord. - Hebich says Mrs Hault. grew cool against you because she once wanted to talk with you and show letters and you would not take it, but wished rather she should speak to me. As for me H. has been offended with me when he first saw me at Palghaut, and then I seemed to him to be opposed to his spirit. I of course do not recollect it, it was when I had Mrs Leslie with me. Heb. is very nice and Taylor lives with him in our old house. Fritz is not well at all it looks like intermittent fever. Schlunk is nice, but Mack looks rather dead, he was sick to death by exposing himself on the pattimar to the sun in spite of every warning. David's clothes, your thread etc will soon come also borers etc for Laufer

BÃ¼hrer saw my sister in law at Staefa and thought her rather nice 
Now farewell to all
 Your HGdt.


1My dear Mr Hoch.

The Post office is not .....
