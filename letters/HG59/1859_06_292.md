 Calicut 29th June 59
My sweet Paul

Dear papa says that you are just the same as when you had your portrait taken in 55 so I can see you and I do often look at all your pictures. I was glad to hear that your leg is well again. is Samuels one well too? Have you soon regained in your lessons what you lost during the sickness or the time you were in bed?

Next month you are perhaps going to Corcelles with papa. After so many pleasures and joys you are going to have, you will learn very diligently I hope being thankful for so many good things God gives you.

Give also my love to all your little companions
 With a kiss your Mama
 Adieu dearest Paul
 J.G

Hier höre ich ihr seyd mit Jubel eingezogen Hoffentlich dauert der Jubel noch lange nach, und nach dem Jubel ein ruhiger anhaltender Fleiß um wieder recht ins Lernen zu kommen. Laß Dich nicht nur so ane gehen, sondern streng Dich einmal recht an. Gelt wie beim Turnen. Nun Adieu
 Dein Vater
