My dear Frederic1

I was quite amused with your description of the laws of the Kinderhouse, it is very nice and not at all strikt as the Spartians, by whom the children were made such fine warriors. One must also bear a yoke to become a good soldier. ...ist for it is written: It is a good* thing for a man to bear the yoke in his youth. I have often felt what a benefit it has been for me to have been brought up roughly and rather severely; it makes the rest of ones life so much more easy than it would be other wise.

My sweet Frederic I rejoice for you, that you shall D.V. see your dear papa. I was very sorry to hear that you had again headach and were kept from school. My precious Frederic, I would also have been very glad to see you all; but it may* be, please God, later.

Now I have much to do Papa will give you many kisses for me to you three little Ones

 Your loving mother Julie G.
