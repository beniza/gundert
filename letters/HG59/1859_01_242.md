Mrs Gundert, Calicut

 24 Jan 59
My dear Mary

Mrs B<Ã¼hrer>* has never visited Kornthal does not know Mrs Daur etc. I found that Herm must have mistaken about their laughing at the kiss which Grandmama etc gave Esther, for old Hochstetter generally kissed Esther. - Stenography is shorthand writing (from steno = narrow which means closely compressed writing) Mrs Haller I see little of, she goes on pretty well in Engl I think. Mrs Hoch is concerned about her Theophil, Mrs Hauff happy to see her baby so much better now. Mack is a queer man. He takes now and then to speculation, and wants to finish a new system of divinity, the old systems being evidently not enough for him. He sits in his room and must abstain from work, so much has he hurt his health by stupid exposure on board the Pattimar. - Mr Briegel appears to be more childlike.

I hope to return soon, for I do not feel strong enough to travel much about here. Taylor will leave this evening for Honore to bring the Bishop down. 
The Lord be with you and keep you sitting quietly at his feet. In His school you are safe and may yet learn how to teach others
