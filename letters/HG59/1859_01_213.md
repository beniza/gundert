 Calicut 21 Ja 59
My precious Frederic

I was glad to see by your last letter that your health is some what better than formerly and trust you will now learn diligently so as to be no more the last of your class, that s indeed very sad. You will be very sorry by and by to have neglected such a good time Unbelieve and the devil tell you it is of no use to pray. I have tried many times and it is worse, your heart says is it not? but it is not the Bible's language Oh my precious Frederic do not give way to unbelief it is a wicked thing. The dear Lord Jesus loves you and He will help you, do not be angry in your little heart against the dear Saviour, Unbelief says with the devil God does not love, if He did He would help you to learn: than you get displeased with God and every thing goes wrong is it not? Oh my sweet Frederic believe in the love of Jesus, He waits for you and is most ready to help you Ask him to break the stony heart, to melt it, to give you faith in Him in His love towards you. this is my chief prayer for you, with out faith you can obtain nothing nor be kept from evil. I hope my dearest Frederic that when papa Gundert comes to Bale he will here from your papa Meruet that you are now good and like to learn With a kiss
 your Mama J. Gundert
