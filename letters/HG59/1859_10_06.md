My dearest Marie

Good morning I trust you had a good night in the cool country, with worm friends. Apropos Copy for papa Mr Hebich letter from the Spectator I would like also to read it. Kindly send to Mrs Moegli the last letters of Papa and any thing which might interest them if F has them already try to get them back.

As I have the women and not much to say I write only a few lines; My beloved bien aimâ€še what are you doing? Do not ride alone you know that sometime Buffalos run after horses and you might be hurt very much, be sure dear child that you will not go alone and in dangerous places! Ask advice to dear Mr Stanes and to the brethren I feel anxious about you! promise me not to ride alone? I am surprised at Mr. Diezs way of traveling, if you all get fever I would not wonder. Why not do as other people. set out early the morning. and evoid fevrish places!

Love to all the dear friends. Adieu my precious child

 Your Mama
