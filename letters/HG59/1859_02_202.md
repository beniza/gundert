Dear Papa

Yesterday came a note from Madras acknowledging the receipt of 20-6-6 balance of your subscription to the Athenum I have put it in your drowe you do not require it I suppose. Am I to send you the gazettes?

By this time we hope you are safe at Mangalore and are well! What news had Fritz from home and how is he?

Here all as usual glad am I that we are a small house. Mrs Moeri with child very quiet, helping in all she can; Marie seems to like her! her boy is a fine little fellow, so tormented by bugs during the night that he slept almost nothing now the mama took him with her in the big bad. Moerike wants a big badstead for the Hills offer him ours at Manga for 20 or to any one there, it is more easy to get two small ones and more comfortable than a large one. Mr Glasson has charged Lauffer to write to Stanger inquiring what would be his terms in taking charge of his plantation; the young man he had has got in disgrace with the people did spit to their faces and quarrelled so that Gl. will be obliged to send him off. He is still here with his son, the fault of his suprintendant were told him by one of his man whom he trust who came expr≈†s down

Love to all
 Yours J. Gundert
