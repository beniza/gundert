Dear Papa

Many thanks for you two dear letters of the 24. 25 which came together this morning. I have sent Abraham for the money. I rejoice to hear you are again better; but dear papa I hope you make up your mind to go home in March or April for it is not right to try any longer to stay here. To have seen Moegling so fresh and nice has I hope decided you to try the bath too which may with God's grace bring you good health again. While here you but linger on and force yourself to work. I feel thank God better. but I see that I must get more rest now and than. Now dear Papa Adieu I have inclosed this to Mr. P in case you should have left already.
 Yours affectly J. Gundert


2My very dear papa

Many thanks for your little note. This morning I took a ride by myself and went over the channel to look what was on the other side of it and found it nice. Mrs Mörike is always cheerful and kind, it seems everyone is so and only I am so often cross and naughty. I am often quite ashamed of my-self Oh! I shall be very happy to have you back again, my dear papa! - I often desire to have more real longing after Jesus, but alas! how often I do not care much for Him! How much He cares for me! Truly it is almost incomprehensible

But I must tell you … Dieu! With love your own child M.
