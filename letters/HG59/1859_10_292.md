Miss Gundert, care of W. Stanes Esqr., Coonoor, Stamped

 Calicut 29th Oct [1859]
My dearest Marie

I should have written yesterday and thank Mr and Mrs S. for their kind letters; but I was to busy the morning and the afternoon cutting 200 and some jaquetts for the girls. Next sunday we have the Lord supper and if all goes well by Gods grace we set out so as to be at Kaity on thrusday night. I go of course to Kaity and by and by shall D.V. pay a visit to Coonoor to all the dear fiends there but specially to dear Mr and Mrs St who have been so kind to you. if I faind Kaity too cool we may perhaps find a little room at Coonoor for us both. though I am told it is very difficult or rather impossible. however we will see. Thanks for yours of yesterday My best thanks to Mr and Mrs Stanes untill I can thank myself. Why should you be a martir for all your life about one person with whom you can not be certain you would have had such a happy life! oh what a plague is the heart, what chains has not the devil to tie us away from the Lord and his will.

Adieu dear Child pardon haste from your affectionate
 Mama J. Gundert
