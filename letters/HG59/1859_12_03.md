Dear Papa

Yours of the 20th Oct came in hand yesterday just as we were leaving the Stanes to come to the Strobles. Thank God that you are not worse, as I had some fears.

Marie is well, less taken with that man I think though she is not free as yet. for a while I thought there was a look toward Thom. Stanes; as I tried to know how far it may be, she said He would not take such a foolish girl as I am. I than said that I thought you would as well as myself rather have her marying a missionary than an other man. She than said well I have not yet met one in our mission whom I could like. However I think there is* nothing with Thome St. Dear papa try if possible to come near Herman he seems to be still afraid of you. Do all you can to show him love, so that he may come nigh you else he shall not profit much of your being there. I pity the poor boy; but so he is, he wants to find a warm and burning heart as his. though it is much fleshly have pity with him and do your best. in gentleness to give him confidence in you

 Yours affectly
 Julie Gundert
