 Mangal Tuesday 18 Janry 1859.
An Mama:

Just 2 years since we bid the Buhrer's goodbye and now I have seen them again and heard how gladly David would again have accompanied them. We left Tellich. Sunday night. Fritz not at all well, anemetic helped however to get him round. Monday morning off Cann. Heb was not ready, 4 hours were wanted to get him on board, thence in 24 hours up. Heb. happy with his grandson and praising his kitchen etc. Took breakfast off Mang. landed, saw Missy (Will) who related how Richter was brought to his senses by Mögls visit - but Mrs Schmid was very bad - R. had a son on the 4th - Missy looks well, the Hauff poorly, - Robert Dobbies son had yesterday died of cholera at Hoch's - We came then up, I on horseback as the others went first to Hoch. Mrs Bührer looks very well. In going home David once wept much, she tried to comfort him but after a time wept herself. Next morning she asked him why did you weep yesterday. He hung his head and asked in return: Why did you weep yesterday. So the story ends. Taylor is with us here, Schlunk is a strong Prussian, rather a little High Church. Now I will say goodbye and may the Lord keep you all in body and soul. It was a nice trip up along the coast. The Sauvains as blind as ever - see no faults in themselves would only wish Ald quickly to go to Chir and make room for themselves. 
 Farewell
 your HGdt.
