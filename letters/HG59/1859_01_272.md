My dear Marie

I am glad indeed you see what a happy man G<ompertz>* is in working for others. There he buries the dead, prays with the sick comforts the bereaved, gives the pay to his Sepoys, keeps his books and accounts, drills and commands, and knows all along he does his Savior's work. For if he was not good in his daily task of routine, people would only laugh at him if he preached to them. Therefore the disagreeable part of our daily work is the chief point in which grace is to be shown. A man who from love to God does daily what he would not prefer, becomes thereby able to perform all sorts of extraordinary service. So it will also be with you. We must often labor most drudgingly before we get a bright moment say for leading a soul to Christ. Therefore we will get ready for such honorable service by quiet endurance in every day's business until his hour comes yea - and though it should never come, merely to please Him
 Your Papa
