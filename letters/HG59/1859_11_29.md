My dearest Paul

I am sure you will not be offended at my writing you only a few lines. First of all I must thank you as well as your brothers for having written me in letters which I can read easily, the joy which your letters give me in this way is much greater for I like to read them more than once. 
I am much with you in these days since I heard dear papa is less well. 
I wish to all of you a happy Christmas the very best would be to recieve Christ Himself in your hearts by faith, He is far better than all the gifts you may imagine real happiness is in Him. Without Him nothing is truly nice 
I hope you have joy in learning and perhaps also in obedience which is a very great gain. When I see Mrs Hochs boys I am reminded of you and am some time quite absorbed my thoughts following you far far away. The dear David has often sang me early in the morning "there is a happy land where saints meet to part no more" Well dear Sons let us live in view of that happy land in which Jesus is the center here Jesus there Him again in Him Adieu  your Mama
