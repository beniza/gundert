Master Paul Gundert1

 Kaity 13th Nov. [1859]
My sweet Paul

It is a long time I have not written to you. Accept also now my thanks for your last letter which I was glad to get. You do not say whether you are learning diligently, nor how you stand in your class, first, second, third? nor what testimonies you get.

Apropos I hear that two of the Gunderts do not like to give for the mission box are you one of them? Some of our little black girls are much better than you, they are ful of joy to get one cash to give for the mission and though they get very seldom a little fruit, if they were asked what they prefere the fruit or the money for it some would say the money to put for the mission. I am truly sorry to think that perhaps one of you likes better put his cash for chocolat or sugar than for the Lord s work or for a poor who would want a little bread. If my boys had a mind to give they would get often good testimony which would bring them cash to be given joyfully for the Lord, love of self and for self is a miserable cursed love be affraid of it

Adieu my sweet dear child with a tender kiss
 Your Mama
 J. Gundert
