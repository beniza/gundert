My dear wife

Friday evening I rode to Buntwal on one of Boesinger's horses. Was rather tired but slept as I hadn't done for a long time. Saturday school examined - all lowcastes and Maplahs, little intelligence. In the evening on boat to come down the river. Very quiet passage, had 2 AM to walk from Anderson's passage but felt that I grew stronger again. Slept again till morning read Gomp's letter, heard Buhrer's sermon and then got your letter. Heard also of Vernon's arrival from Mrs Irion (to Mrs B.) This is so far fine news. We shall see Strobel with his bride and may the Lord give them joy and peace. No further accounts from Harihar. If you hear no more from me - expect me about Thursday evening, but of course I have not yet found my pattimar and must see whether I get one for Wednesday morning. On Tuesday I may yet see Taylor returning with the Bishop. One evening Mr Fennel called, perhaps I try and see him also and ask him, why he told Taylor, that from the time of their conversion German Missionaries fancy themselves unable to sin. This annoyed me really after the good accounts they had given of Fennell. Now farewell love to all esp dear Marie No time for more
 Your HG
