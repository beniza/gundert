 <31 Juli 61>*
Dear Marie

A few lines only I am glad to hear you are well. I hope you will be quite well when you return. Give my love to all the relations and friends there. 
To day Mr Isenberg with his little brother dined with us, they walked yesterday from Kornthal to this, Dr Barth is in Nagold where he spends his birthday <31 Juli>*, Mrs Handle keeps his house, I have seen her twice, You have had news from us by tante Vicke or Jettle, David is just in a wet sheet, he went one day in Mr Doertenbach's garden to eat Groseilles there he spoiled his stomach and since has not been well.

Miss Friedel will have paid you a visit she came to us with Miss Dortebach who is it seems much changed by her acquaintance with Miss F. After your return she will make friendship with you, she wishes to get acquainted with pious people

From your friends here you have had letters. Our two boys F. and P are well the first some what tired with his work.

Adieu dear Marie love to all with a kiss from
 Your Mama
 Julie Gundert
