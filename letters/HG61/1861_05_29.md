My dear wife!

Only a word to greet you where ever you may now be. I hope you came to B without the rain which threatened yesterday evening and reached us only in the night. MÃ¶gl's have written, they are happy at Kissingen, he weighs 190, Pauline exactly 90 __, now he wishes to lose 25 and add the same to her weight. He wrote much love to you, all in a letter to Barth which the latter sent to me from Stuttg without however adding a line of his own. I trust however he is going on pretty well. What we shall do with Julius I do not yet quite see; he will probably be some days at Zavelstein, and then we can consider what more is to be done. I don't like to send him to Stuttg as the others are made more wild by his presence than they would otherwise be. Carl is nice and gives good answers. Dav. perfectly charmed with the progress in his garden. You will have had a hot day in the rail carriage but I trust Fred has escorted you well and made a beginning of acting in a merchant's capacity. It will surely be nice to see also the people in the 2 Kinderhauses, give them all my love. I am now much with my thoughts in Bale and trust you like the change. The Lord be with you and your  H.
