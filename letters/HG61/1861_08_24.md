 <24 Aug 1861.>*
My dear Herman

A few lines only to thank for your last. and tell you that we are still in Spirit with you and fight for you by prayers wishing much hunger and thirst for the word of life with out which you are dead. May you be so dependent on the help of God that you be forced to cry always for help, wisdome grace and all what you want.

Adieu dear Son, I am in a hurry
 your Mama
 J. Gundert
