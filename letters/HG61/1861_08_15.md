 <Am 13. war ich Nachts 2 1/2 von Calw nach Stuttg. Mama schreibt schon ->* 
My dearest Herman

After you had left us I felt much heimweh and the whole day I was with you in spirit and am still.

Your letter <v. Stuttg>* has given me much joy and I hope you will with God's grace continue to read the word of life diligently and pray often, there is no other way for us to live truly with the Lord without these two ways he has ordered Him self.

You have been much more happy these last days than formerly, is it not? and we what a joy have we not felt in the hope that now you become as a child who will be led by his Heavenly father

Oh dear Herman there will be still some unhappy days and fightings but be of good chear, all is possible to him that believes We have to fight, and overcome we must if we will have a crown of life and you know by what evermore those who are in heaven have overcome.

May you have much hunger and thirst! your mouth wide open, it shall be filled

Adieu my beloved son write us soon and tell us all about you  Your Mama J. Gundert
