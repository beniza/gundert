My dear wife

Just received your letter of 7 June. I hope my letters are received, tho' you speak only of one. I am glad you find the stay at Corcelles worth your while and may it be the same in the other parts. The boys have had a longer vacation in consequence of the building going on in the school. Mrs Hunziker they say may also have to return on account of ulceration in the womb. Convert seems to suffer from enlargemt of the heart. Poor fellow he took Esau's and Subaya's cases too much to heart. I have no doubt these sort of things are the real cause. We go on quietly enough here. It is quite right if you come on that Monday. We have then to talk before I set out for the Wildbad - for a Missionfeast and then for Basle. - Paul has had very good testimonials at Lauffen. He should the next time be accompanied by David. The latter thinks often of you and is somewhat grieved to hear of your lengthened stay. Julius may return to day or not, as the case may be I wrote, but perhaps not in time to prevent his coming here before the lessons begin again. We have bought firewood for the boys to transport during their free time. Otherwise everything moves regularly enough. Dr B. will not go to Bale tho' Inspector has invited him again. The Vietor's are here. Farewell for the present and may the Lord keep you and bless your visits  Your HGdt

love to the sisters and friends.
