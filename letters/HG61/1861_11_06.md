My dear wife

The boys' letters arrived this morning after Mr Müller had come and greeted us. Yesterday evening I left Tübingen with Marie and found Ernst and Gustav at the Terminus. About 9 o clock we arrived here. E. went to see his bride and found Victor decidedly better. He talks now and then about his soul, says that he is not prepared to die, asks about the Lord's supper but of course all more or less in delirium. Mglg reports that Pauline is very poorly - still fever and diarrhoea The children from Basle are now expected at Fcft. - I am now going to the brethren's meeting. So no more for the present. I hope these busy hours will soon be over and I back at my work. Love to all, esp also the dear Dr
