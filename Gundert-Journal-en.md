foreword

Since the first occupation with his writings and letters suspected

Editor that Dr. Hermann Gundert must have written a diary. Big

was therefore the joy when this was available. That goes for Ms. Rita Spring and

My heartfelt thanks to Mr. Georg Schürle from Steinhaus in Calw.

Already during the transmission of Gundert's handwritten notes

into a typewritten manuscript, the immediacy and openness were convincing

and honesty with which Hermann Gundert describes his adventures and experiences

wrote. This impression intensified during further processing and ver¬

deepened in the writings, letters, letter drafts enclosed with the diary,

reports and fragments. The first days of the evangelical church in Malabar

through the Basel Mission are linked to the towns of Tellicherry, Cannanore

and Anjerkandi, later with Chombala, Badagara, Chirakkal, Taliparamba, Calicut

and Palghat. Basel missionary communities formed in these places. The first,

who worked there in the service of the Basel Mission was Hermann Gundert. Next to

of his missionary work he took care of an orderly

schooling. In this he was greatly supported by his wife Julie nee Dubois.

A printing works was soon set up, in which tracts, school books,

Parts of the Bible and other writings were printed. Gundert drew one with it

pioneering path that has proven to be viable for many decades

proved. Gundert's versatile skills also included his brilliant language

talent, his extensive knowledge of languages and his linguistic creators

power. This was evident in diverse works such as the Tamil and Malayalam

grammars, collections of proverbs, catechisms, liturgies, songs, universal

and church histories, tracts, translations into Malayalam and German,

the Malayalam Bible Translation and the Malayalam-English Dictionary.

As a missionary, linguist and literary creator, Dr. Herman Gundert

to the great personalities of the Basel Mission from the Swabian Pietis¬

mus. Departure, breadth and the ability to engage in dialogue gave him access to the Indian

spiritual world, which ranges from the orthodox Hindu to the European bon vivant, from the fana¬

tic Muslim to the fatalistic animist. In this diversity

Gundert showed a clear path for a Christianity shaped by the Occident

in new surroundings. This is reflected in his diary. Because it avoids

largely the family and focuses on the missionary community

educational events of the message of salvation. For Hermann Gundert was Christ

the middle of his life. Everything else was subordinate to him. The diary

is thus a living mission story for the local church and the Be¬

beginning of evangelical church history in Malabar. The editor sees in

the publication of this diary a contribution to dealing with the

own missionary history and the processing of church history in Mala¬

bar. What at that time by the Württemberg and Swiss missionaries

started comes back to us today as a challenge and an inspiration.

No church can exist on its own, but is dependent on

that she gets involved in the togetherness that is laid out in the New Testament -

on the coexistence of different Christian characteristics and different

those religions.

At the same time, Hermann Gundert's writings illustrate the interdependence of various

those areas of life and thinking that cannot be torn apart. speech¬

research, mission and literature production belong together and have

its impact on all social spheres. With research and comparison

ment of the Dravidian, ie South Indian languages, was assigned to Hermann Gundert

one of the fathers of Dravidology. To this day, his work is not only recognized by the

local Indologists, but also valued by Indian linguists and

consulted again and again. In his dual work as a missionary and as a linguist

scientist is Hermann Gundert's lasting admonition and challenge,

especially for those who want to separate one from the other. Gundert

neither planned nor taught the dialogue, but lived and shaped it.

If the diary stood alone, it would remain a torso. Therefore, this volume should soon

However, to get a reasonably complete picture of Hermann Gundert's work and

To get work in India, his letters should also be indexed and sealed

For a better understanding, sketches of maps were added to the diary, as well

twenty pictures published by the editor or his wife in December 1973, im

February 1976 and May 1979 respectively. The pictures on pages xv

and 333 are from the album of Emma Plebst née Gundert - owned by

dr Hermann Gundert was born in Stuttgart on February 4, 1814 and died on

April 25, 1893 in Calw. His father, Ludwig Gundert, was the founder of the Tract

Society in Stuttgart and one of the fifteen founders of the Stuttgart Bible

society, of which he was appointed first secretary. Between balls of paper

and printing press Hermann Gundert spent his childhood years. five and a half years old

he entered the Stuttgart Gymnasium together with his older brother Ludwig.

In 1827 he moved to the ecclesiastical seminary in Maulbronn and joined in 1831

to the evangelical monastery in Tübingen. He studied at the University of Tübingen

evangelical theology and philosophy. His studies were influenced by David

Friedrich Strauss, from whom he later distanced himself as an objective critic.

Hermann Gundert turned to Pietism in 1833, the year his mother died

The connection to his mother (Christiane née Enßlin) was so strong that he

genuine pietistic piety could not be pushed aside. Also he did

the painful experience that he doesn't just deal with his problems and questions with the

ratio could solve. Through the experience of an answered prayer where a

fellow students who were about to commit suicide reconsidered, connected with

Gundert's desire to become a missionary in India. His devotion to

Pietist group, however, soon got a clarification. After the suicide of one

other fellow students he attended his funeral and was the only one of the pietisti¬

schen group of students at the funeral feast. He experienced the loneliness between

the spiritual currents, but also the carrying capacity of the faith. He caught

to preach and inspired children in particular with its vividness. in the

In 1835 he passed the theological exam and was awarded in May of the same year

to the Dr. phil. PhD.

Around this time he received an inquiry from the eng¬ via the Basel Missionshaus

private missionary Groves, as tutor for his sons to Cal-

cutta, india. From November 1835 to April 1836 Gundert prepared

in Bristol, England, to leave the country. He learned Hindi and Bengali, that

he then taught fellow passengers on the ship, including Julie Dubois

was. After the ship dropped anchor at Madras, Groves made up his mind

summarily to stay in Madras. Now Tamil and Telugu was learned. That I

The famous missionary TE Carl Rhenius worked there. Gundert should be with him

learn the Tamil language and be introduced to missionary work. In this

time already he started ? a Tamil grammar and a universal history in Tamil

to write for the lesson at the catechist seminar in Tirunelveli. On his

Returning to Madras, he made the decision to found a mission station,

to which Groves, after some hesitation, agreed.

Chittoor became a fitting place in the language border area of Tamil and Telugu

found. In August 1837 Hermann Gundert held his first Tamil sermon there,

and at Christmas he was able to join three converts to Christianity

Sent to South India from London, died there in 1838.

Indians celebrate the Lord's Supper - a profound experience that brings him to humility

God and into the joy of proselytizing. From then on it was the highest thing for him

to celebrate communion with Indians or after the ordination of the first

local catechists to receive bread and wine from Indian hands. the

Working with Groves, however, was increasingly fraught with tension. In

At this time, Gundert found the familiar and advisory partner in the Lascelles family

Connection. Frau Lascelles then also gave the final impetus to marrying her

Julie Dubois from Corcelles near Neuchatel, who works for Mrs. Groves on

July 23, 1838.

Just a week after the wedding, the two said goodbye to Chittoor,

that to them in the year and a quarter with its small community and school

had grown fond of. To the hardships of the journey to Tirunelveli came the question

for a future field of activity. Gundert's thoughts coincided with them

of the Basel missionaries in Mangalore. They wrote to him asking for it

Mangalore to come - at the same time Gundert wrote to her and asked for admission.

When the invitation came, Hermann and Julie Gundert left, relieved and delighted

further. In Nagercoil Gundert found a man who was responsible for printing his Tamilaus¬

works - a Hebrew grammar, a detailed church history

except for Gregory VII and a Greek lexicon. From Quilon

they went by ship to Mangalore - past Tellicherry. On November 2nd

In 1838 the former college friends Herrmann Mögling and Hermann fell out

Gundert in (jJje arms. The Gunderts had found their sphere of activity. Dr. Herr-

man Mögling and Hermann Gundert had extraordinary talents that

reflected in numerous publications. Both stayed for life, too

through grave differences, friends. Opposite them was Samuel

Hebich, who together with the missionaries Joh. Chr. Lehner and Chr. Leonh. Greiner

as the first Basel missionary to South India and on October 30, 1834 to Mangalore

had come, the ardent evangelist, who preferred to preach at festivals and

traveled from one place to another.

In January 1839 Hermann Gundert, a former catechist, set out

Rhenius to visit the large cinnamon plantation in Anjerkandi. his way

led him via Tellicherry, where he stayed a few days, and the Rich¬

ter Strange met. On February 27th he offered his house in Tellicherry on the

Hügel Nettur to the Basel Mission with the condition that he be given a mission station

erect. Hermann Gundert was born together with Joh. Jak. Dehlinger from the gene

ral conference of the Mangalore brothers in Tellicherry. Because of a heavy

Dehlinger, however, had to move away again after just a few weeks due to illness.

On April 12, 1839, Hermann and Julie Gundert reached Tellicherry. Already at

April 18 their eldest son Hermann was born. Gundert quickly found himself in the

Malayalam, which he studied intensively, and tried to establish a community

found or, as in Anjerkandi, to improve the situation. It can be as

be seen as a merit that in the local area the school system unites

boom and slave labor was abolished. Lots of orphans

found admission in the girls' home, which was managed by Julie Gundert. Because

away from the city center location of the mission house on Nettur rented

2. Born April 29, 1803 d. May 21, 1868.

Gundert soon a house in the middle of the city Tellicherry, right at the bazaar. Thereby

he could come together better and more sustainably with the population. Rather

he distributed tracts and invited this or that to a conversation

home. After two years, the Gundert family moved back into the mission bungalow

on net.

Gundert's literary works quickly took shape. Already in October 1839

he founded a tract society in Tellicherry. But not all

The tracts written by him were approved by the Basel mission leadership.

Gundert had too much Indian, "mythological"

co-processed (a similar accusation was made years later when he was reading textbooks

wrote and wanted to publish - they were partly dismissed with the reason

denies that they contained too few biblical stories). In the following

Years later the first editions of his Malayalam grammar and syntax appeared,

as well as an extensive collection of proverbs. Gundert's goal from the start was

to familiarize themselves with the Indian way of life and way of thinking in order to convert to Christianity

to be able to give an Indian expression from the outset. He thought that one

The generation of missionaries was enough to gain a core for Christianity, which then

in turn, spreading the gospel in Indian garb without the help

the European drove on. This marked Gundert's time by a century

ahead. He had the humility and patience, the hope and vision, to

independent Indian evangelical congregation and church system already in the early period

full responsibility at the first stage.

Through his interest in Indian thinking and through his talent for languages

representatives of various religions and denominations opened up to him

of opposites and led to respect and charisma for Christianity

of the gospel, struck hard. Hermann Gundert was the right from the start

is to be explained that at the IX All India Conference of Dravidian Linguists 1979

in Calicut by an eminent scholar - a Hindu - Gundert as a missionary,

Linguist and saint could be called (in distant Kerala

Gundert is more respected and appreciated than in his own country!). Through the green

formation of a weekly newspaper in Tellicherry and through its good reputation as a medi¬

Chinese adviser and helper, Hermann Gundert enjoyed a high reputation among

the people who came to him without discrimination. He could be very strict with

people who lied to him or stole from him. For the sake of the truth he was startled

did not shy away from chastisements if he had the impression that the person concerned

this could help for the better. In addition to the pedagogical

View and method of education is also to be considered that the first evange¬

Italian Christians came largely from the lowest classes and not infrequently

Itinerant converts were - they didn't like it in a place anymore, so they moved

to the next missionary, allowed themselves to be converted (again) and behaved often enough,

only to move on with a minor indisposition. All the more gratifying ver¬

Gundert noticed when real conversions took place, especially from

people from the higher castes. With them, this was usually done with violent family issues

Disputes accompanied, but not infrequently they became pillars in the

spread of the gospel.

Hermann Gundert's linguistic work had done justice to Malayalam

developing Bible translation to the goal. He set about this task right from the start

the forties. As there was no agreement with the English translator Bailey

came who did a Malayalam Bible translation in Kottayam for the Anglican Church

published, Gundert had to go his own way. This should later prove correct

prove In contrast to Bailey, Gundert strictly followed the Hebrew and Greek

Chinese original text and thus achieved a more exact translation, which also spoke

was significantly better. In addition to the excellent knowledge of Hebrew

and Greek was Gundert's knowledge of the Malayalam standard and vernacular

so good that he was able to create a genuine Malayalam Bible translation. Him

benefited from his - today generally accepted - statement that the Greek

and Hebrew are in many ways closer to Malayalam than any modern Euro¬

paic language. Gundert made contact with the people wherever he could.

This is how he is reported in Kerala: When Hermann Gundert met a farmer on the way

saw him in the field, he went up to him and asked him, "What is in your hand?

What's it called? Do you know another proverb?" and wrote it all down. - His

education and were sent home to attend school. The year 1846 ver¬

brought the Gundert family to Germany and Switzerland on their home leave. Included

Hermann Gundert tirelessly gave lectures, visited many people and spoke

everywhere for the mission in India.

When they returned to India, the church stretched

a revival movement. More and more forces had to be trained, Er¬

education and for the training of native catechists.

Also in the neighboring town of Cannanore, where Samuel Hebich had been working since the summer of 1840,

the work became more and more extensive. It wasn't always easy to get relief

to get. After much deliberation, Tellicherry was recast and Gunderts

moved to Chirakkal on May 21, 1849 to relieve Hebich. Soon afterwards

Gundert developed a chest and larynx disease. Fever and shortness of breath paralyzed

almost him. Eventually the voice failed for nearly three years. Even more

than before he had to devote himself to literary work. Besides tracts, one

improved edition of the Malayalam grammar and syntax, the extended Sprich¬

word collection, various hymnal editions, liturgies, school books and

of a K. story, step by step, the Malayalam translation of the new

Testamentary Epistles, Revelation and the Gospels, the Psalms and

minor prophets. They were printed on the Tellicherry press and found

throughout the Malayalam-speaking area, which aligns largely with present-day Kerala

covers, great attention. Although Gundert found it difficult, the silent time as one

good experience - because what should a missionary do without a voice - it shows

today that it was this time that was essential for the foundation of the Basel Missions¬

Church in Malabar contributed. With the created church registers and the Bible translation

The evangelical congregation had a good basis for new growth.

This young church found its place in the multi-religious society

of India.

1. Probably church history, but could also mean Kerala history.

In the middle of this fruitful creative period, Gundert was killed in 1856 by his Be¬

called out to Mangalore. Relocation there meant not only

an ordinary change of location, but also the transition to another language

area. Because Mangalore is already in Karnataka (Kannada), in the Canary language

or Tulu is spoken. The tangled community situation in Mangalore made

Gundert's presence required. He solved the problems with his own

Openness, straightforwardness, rigor and steadfastness, but also with love,

confidence, hope and patience. He succeeded after a short time, the community

to either persuade harmful persons of another or to exclude them.

At the end of 1857 Gundert's daughter Marie, who later became the mother of Hermann Hesse,

returned to India and accompanied her father on many a trip. Because in the

In the meantime another change had taken place. Herman Gundert was

Became Government Schools Inspector for Malabar and South Kanara areas. Of the

Residence was moved to Calicut. Gundert's task consisted in the visitation

and advising schools from Trichur in the south to Dharwar in the north. The out

Extensive travel activities eroded Gundert's health to such an extent that after less

retired from government service after two years. His health was like this

affected that he no longer devotes himself to missionary work

could. So he decided to take a leave of absence and took up residence on April 12, 1859

Calicut bids farewell to his Erau and daughter, firmly bland

year to be back. But his health improved only slowly,

and the Basel Mission did not want to send him out again. Since the Calwer Verlags¬

just found a successor for 'Dr. Barth was looking for, Gundert was suggested

to take this position. He accepted her and moved to Calw. with a heavy heart

His wife also left India and came to Calw with their daughter.

Although the publishing work, combined with a lot of traveling, completely exhausted him

filled, Hermann Gundert found the time to finish the Malayalam-English dictionary

to deliver. This was after anxious worries and also under unusual circumstances

were printed in Mangalore on the missionary press and was over by the end of 1872

thousand pages ready. It became the standard dictionary for a long time

Malayalam and is still used and cited as a recognized authority today.

Last but not least, the saying in India that Gundert is goes back to this work

an Indian who was accidentally born in Germany.

Hermann and Julie Gundert also spent their old age in Calw. In the life sketch

at the funeral of his wife, who died on September 18, 1885, Hermann summed up

Gundert the stay in India in the words: "Then she has the language

learned, worked with all his might and love on the hearts of girls and women

teaches, taught from morning to evening and yet his own children,

that God gave her are not neglected. to concentrate on what is necessary

to do the task of each hour with all your soul and not yourself

to take it easy had become part of her other nature. What help I had with her in

all the difficult cases that can befall a lonely missionary family,

can only be hinted at. As to the control of truth, let it be said that it is not merely

at work, but also in inner life, was more of a support to me than I was to her.

I was still a young Christian while undergoing an unusual series of experiences

struggles and battles behind him. The seriousness of life, the hollowness of

world, the ruses of the enemy, the need to gather together for battle,

the constant recourse to prayer and faith, the bliss of standing alone

with God, she had recognized all this more thoroughly, she had practiced more regularly,

as the poor candidate driven by various interests; so is her

Perhaps more enduring fruit has been bestowed than me."

In this judgment, too, Hermann Gundert characterizes himself to a certain extent

above all, it shows his deep respect for the other, as well as his own

Modesty to praise others more than himself. After his death

on April 25, 1893, Pastor Kinzler from Basel held on behalf of the Basel Mission

an obituary. He said, "Out in Malabar, East India, he's the front

You have been the founder and father of our mission church there

the word of God given in their tongue and tongue and otherwise by word and

Scripture sown the seed of the gospel for a quarter of a century

and cultivated the sprouted seed with all loyalty and devotion. Just yesterday

nor has an elderly Malabar missionary just returned

told me about the blessing of the many years of work of Dr. Gundert in that

country, and like many a native preacher and teacher and congregation still today

members remember this of their spiritual father with heartfelt thanks."

With Hermann Gundert, connections become visible that are essential for a sustainable collaboration

one another among men, among peoples and among people of different kinds

Continents, races and religions are fundamental. The occupation with the

other culture and landscape opens up new ways and accesses to us

People. About the experience of the mission get dialogue among people

and ecumenism new, decisive impulses. Hermann Gundert deepened

into the Malayalam language and created through his Bible translation and other languages

scholarly works a basis for the evangelical church in Malabar, yes

for all of Kerala. History teaches that such work goes further than

all material help. Gundert's dialogue began with thinking, changed it and

thus gave rise to the social change that took place with the gathering of the Christians

meinden, a secure hold that points the way for the future

and became pregnant.

The found diary of Hermann Gundert begins with his student days and

has regular entries from 1832. There are no records of

his stay in England and from the early days in India. From September 1st

Gundert's handwriting allows for variations in reading. So 1 can be read instead of t

Friday, 1 September 37. Commencement of the English-Telugu-School by the 3 brethren.

4 September, Monday. Commencement of Mrs. G. Day School intended primarily for girls on the

compound. 2 girls only came on the first day. As those girls who come get daily

one meal in the compound, more will come, as soon as it is known.

Tuesday, the 5th. I began an exploratory tour in the western valley of Chittoor on the Palmaner

road, taking Andrew and Vedamuttu with me in the bullock bandi. Stopped first

at Iruvaram, a v/illage of Telugu Rettis, rieh people it seems, who have a great

desire for a school. They were shy in the beginning, but took books; I was especially

interested in a modest young Brahmin who acquired not without concern it appears.

Walked from them to the Pariar village on the foot of the Mountains, behind

Iruvaram. These are all Tamiler; as none knows to read I had offered them a

school already several weeks ago. But apprehensions of the kind so common amongst

them led them hitherto to seek for excuses. They come neither to a decisive

no, nor to a decisive yes. Sat under the big tree, under which their 8 stone

idols - roundshaped &lt;as*&gt; stones, without any human resemblance, of different

sizes between 1/2 and 2 feet height anointed with oil are placed. We had a lively

conversation about them, and the contrast of the living God (one man calls them

servants, Butler, Meti, Sweeper etc. of the great Turei God). They find no other

excuse against our doctrine except that they do not yet see this our God: as

soon as they shall see him in the other world they will - say they - believe

and understand him at once. I directed them from the eyes to the ears. If a

father standing behind the house, calls the child, the child has to come, as

soon as it is sure that it is the father's voice. I feel much comfort in the

view offlCl••• Plato takes for our knowledge of divine things. "My sheep

know my voice" - heathens also feit it, only in an inexpressible way - there

is some(^u&gt;5 a priori which distinguishes between different lights some recollection

of a voice, of a tender fatherly voice which once was heard and understood by

man in his childhood. -'"He who believes this will be mightily encouraged to

set the witness of the light before the heathens without fear or an immoderate

desire after proving every point. - As I went back through the Retti village,

several men followed me to the tree where I drank my coffee, and got more familiär

under conversations about the business and state of a Missionary that he is

not sent by the Cumpiniar about salvation, and the necessity of regeneration.

One man feeling the power of sin asked how evil lusts and desires can be banished.

I wish I could more paint before their eyes the realities and beauty of heavenly

things. But they are bound up with what appears to the eye undeniable reality,

it appears so sensible to believe that to be the most important what next surrounds

oneself. I took this up and came to the law of loving each other, even one's

neighbour as oneself and doing and wishing as much good to him as to ourselves

- this they acknowledged they never thought of. - Went again back to the Palmaner

road, passed the river, and reached Vencatagherry after a very uniform journey -

only a few houses and a wandering village of Curawers (ear-diggers) with pigs

and dogs appeared on the way through the jungle. - I was pretty exhausted, and

had to wait for some rice tili dusk, as my servant had lost the way. After dinner

went into the village. All Telugus, some Canarese and several Maharashtrar.

A proud fat Brahmin, writer in the Cutcherry, had the goodness to let us talk a

little with him, but only in order to prostitute himself with his belly worship

before the people. He acknowledged in a scoffing light way all to be true what

we said, but he has no time to care or think about these things: the lasting

fire will not please him, but as for now he will not think of it. What gives

a Situation that is* God, was his motto. Some others listed to what we said

1837

and took a few books. Hardly anybody understood our talk. We saw that from here

the border of Tamil begins: as the v/alley was so ... that with our bandi we

could not turn to the south we were obliged to return. On this side therefore

the river will for now form the Western boundary of the sphere allotted to our

labours. Afterwards V/encatagherry might be a nice Station for a school especially

as the residence of the Cutcherry people makes the people less shy against the

Europeans. - We 3 had prayers together, slept well, got up Wednesday about 1 o'clock

and were with daybreak in Chittoor.

Wednesday, 6 September, examination of Lascelles school. The old girls answer very well: it

is a great mercy to see at least so much of Christian knowledge spread through

the rising generation of Chittoor in conseguence of the efforts of dear d'Aere

and his successors. They learn the sermon of the mount and &lt;2? (7 . ■ crzr r ^ „ -

*\ by heart - and understand many great and difficult things with

se and interest, which I wonder at when comparing it with my knowledge

of heavenly things when I was of this age. God bless them more and more with

his spirit!

Thursday, 7 September. 5 o'clock walking tili 7 &lt;to the southwestern valley&gt; - then in the

common bullock bandi - to Nararipetty (6 Tamil miles fr[om] Ch[ittoor]) where we

took our abode in the bungalow (a place without chairs, and hardly ever visited).

The village near to it is small, consists of Bazar Telugus - we spoke with several

high men, sitting down in the verandahs of their houses: they took several Telugu

books, and understood also Tamil, though they do not read it. The big man amongst

them said yes to every thing, confessed also their ignorance, but none of them

though nearly all the men present listened in passing by, seemed to be anxious

for that spiritual food we offered to their souls in return for the bodily food

we and others bought from them. They confessed that they are rieh and want nothing

for the present. One wished us not to trouble him and made a very nice speech,

the contents of which were - all what we say is true etc. but - go. - Well so

we went. - Here an old Tuluken who reads only Persian. - After dinner went to

the village on the road somewhat North - Tantrapetti, a larger place but peopled

with poorer and more ignorant people. They are mostly engaged in reaping cambu:

to some we went into the field, but be it from fear or some other cause they

would not hear, using &lt;for&gt; as shield the common excuse, °T 'ZJ d?

zj la- C /tJ T ^ i s vairy-t 0 teil them, that^—.

just for thisFreason w^/come to them^they go on, p ) /T / **

until you go. I tried it then witly all the other^-fnen in

the villageTwhich I could find: none knows to read. The place being a central

one I offered to establish a school and wished the men to consider it well*

but their fear did not allow them to listen and reason concerning our proposal.

The excuse was, there are no children, and if there are they have all some work

with sheep and oxen and fields. - Went from thence a mile distance (ENE through

the fields) to Vasapalli, a large and wealthy place, accessible only by walking.

Some men we met in the fields were open, and went with us into the village to

consider the guestion of a school with the other men. But the common word was:

what can we do - if the Retti wishes it, well. - After we had spoken with some

people (all Telugus) the big man came, interested in the beginning but then

evidently more and more afraid of the revolution which such a new proceeding

was calculated to produce in the village. If all know to read and write (and

we said, it must be also for Pariars as all are children of one father) if all

1837

5

know God themselues, then where is the monopoly of a headman. Therefore after

a very long conuersation - before plenty of intelligent men, the result was -

no school! for the Retti teaches his sons himself and the others do not want

it. Still we were uery thankful to haue had so much opportunity to teil them

the call of the gospel. The Retti's son (ein interessantes Günzler-Gesicht)

took a tract, but his father obliged him to giue it back. After the Retti had

done I got up, it was already dark - told them in short that we are all Sanda-

ler, fallen from the cast of our father who is the perfection of all qualities,

and hauing become the uery contrary of his nature, that he calls us back, but

that new birth and holiness is necessary, before we shall see his face, be-

cause he can not take his abode in a Sandaler's house. If they wish to remain

outcast, they must at all euents know that the father has called them. - A young

man euidently afraid of the assembly, followed as in secret to the former uillage

and took two tracts. - All what Jesus has said about men is true and justifies

him and his word in my inmost conscience. Because they loue darkness rather

than light, they will hear something new, something burning and shining, but

when it pricks the heart and old custom, they reject it. - I am glad to see

Andrew not discouraged by the people's behaviour. He read before going asleep,

Luke 12 and prayed earnestly with us (ein Trost für mich nach den betrübenden

Erweisen auch seiner Schwachheit in Besoldungssachen).

Friday, 8 September, arriued with daybreak in Pallur bei Bammasamudram 2 miles south. Choultry

on the road Vellore side. Went into the village and talked in the street - all

Telugus, one only reads - the others spoke Tamil. They also feared, haue no

wish for school; are euerywhere surprised of our coming, and haue neuer heard

of Christ euen from afar ( the man could hardly read the name, although he reads

well) still some listed and thought knowledge of heauenly things would be a

good thing, but hard to be attained. They also haue Gurus, the Carma Guru who

teaches what is to be obserued in Tirtams, Asarams etc., and the Gnana Guru

who teils of things eternal - but who knows truth. I told him of the Guru who

came down from heauen, and teaches what he has seen. But the Choultry Peons

unwished for presence and desire to get people to talk with me seemed to make

them glad at my going. - After breakfast walked with Andrew first to the Pariar

uillage south - but no man was to be seen - all in the fields. Then to the Sackili

uillage - east: tried it with euery man - but they would not hear, would not

answer, will not die, want not to go to heauen, will not euen receiue money

because they do not want it, want not to learn, haue no buddhi etc., at last

we went off. Who will find access to these miserabl^beings, who are thus taught

to belieue themselues lower than beasts - «f % !! On the road met a

Muhammedan, who was somewhat open, and confessed bfynaue not got* taught much

of his worthiness to appear before God. Whilst talking with him, a Chittoor

country-born, who seeks a Situation at Vellore passed by, and accepted of my

offer to take some tracts along for distribution on his way. What a comfort

to know that the Lord will bless what appears least before men! - About 3 o'clock

the sun being couered by clouds I went with Andrew to a uillage on the west

side of the road, south of King Bamma's great tank which giues the name to this

place and ualley. The tank is at present empty, but may in the rainy season

fill nearly the whole ualley, which has here a broad bosom. The people, though

they all complain of their pouerty, seem all rieh, haue round storehouses in

their compounds - a thing unseen in Tirunelueli - reap twice, are^nearly all

#&gt;-r ryjj fr / &lt;r ^ £ # &lt;r&gt;r 7 (here common term for - / C2J -nrt -??).

In the first uillage^we now came to no man was to be seen, the women run away -

1837

so we went; the second village directly east to the tank is larger. The men

of the village where the Chattram is, had on a[n] other way ruri betöre us, and

stood together with nearly all the Pariars of the village on the one side of the

road, on the other side gathered by and by the highcastes with haughty manners.

Whilst hardly any had heard of such a thing as ^ ^ Cß an d Jesus,

a highcaste had formerly received a tract in Greenpetti, and others knew of

the different ways and riches of the English through the Taluk, whuse* centre

is in the village. They were therefore less shy than in the other villages.

The Pariars evidently wished a school, but the highcaste after having heard

by Andrew and me the great contents of the gospel rejected it with the excuse

"if the Ganakucaren agrees, there is no obstacle" - but for now we were glad

to have so far overcome their fears, gave some tracts which mostly after some

reading were returned - and returned after having with much weakness, also of

body, delivered our message. To the men who ask us why we come just to them,

we call ourselves &amp; 9 of the great ^ , the Lord of heaven

and earth, who according to his commandment must teil their message to all subjects

of all classes in all villages. None objected to the propriety of our acting in

this way; they said ^, some perhaps despising us for being only messengers

and poor, and not as their Gurus are, telling their own imaginations. - Having

returned to our Chattram with the going down of the sun, a man of the village -

the first - came to us, - and as there feil some rain, took courage to enter

under our roof with us. He took a tract, heard from Andrew the history of man's

fall and read it himself - took also the tract home. Also others came now near

and seemed to have lost of their fear. In this as well as in the other men's

going before us the Tamil mile to the village east of the tank - shows me that

it is of some use, to stay a whole day, or some time in a village, until people

get courage to hear and see one. - Also the Peon heard something, and with the

Bandicaren I had a conversation about the new ashes he had smeared - and about

the way in which Christ was offered as a sacrifice. - East of the Vellore road

the first Tamil tracts were asked for. Those jan the road are nearly all Telugus,

but speak Tamil. - The whole evening I heard the men of the village near tlje

Chattram speak and debate with great interest the merits of our n 2 r~\* ^

They sat under the tree and repeatedly the word &lt;*h/ Cr V

and others came into my ears, though the deliberation/was unintelligiblg/to

me, being carried on in Telugu. ... and the other men are willing to send their

children into a is 6 ^ 7 ^— z --~

but others objec^earnestly. - Slept tili 1 or 2 o'clock, and theri returned on

the road we had come

(Saturday, 9 September). At 3 o'clock, after some rain, we reached a place from which 2 villages

were visible, to the one of which a shed for selling liguors seems an appendix.

We made there fire under a tree, Vedamuttu got goats' milk from a herd near

our tree, and so I had my breakfast. Vedamuttu could not find a place for staying

in the villages, but as I went into the larger one, towards west, Cottapilly

(holy to Puleiar) I saw immediately a riice Chattram, built as we then heard

by the O /Y uS ^ ^ to whom the village belongs;

sent Andrew out to fetch the bandi, and sat down under the large tree before

the Chattram. Immediately people came, and were soon most interested in what they

heard. They also understood me very well, which was a great comfort to me, as

in many cases I had been frightened by people's excuse for their not hearing "I

do not understand your "• - One man especially after leaving us

several times for doing business, returned again and again to hear or to ask.

We spoke especially about the way of Salvation, which I get more desirous to make

the one and only object of my talk. Andrew spoke of their Puranas, endeavouririg

to prove their falsehood; but that they agreed to and wanted only to hear of ours.

0 that we would more announce the kingdom of Christ, whose herolds we are, as the

only object to which men can be invited. I believe now more and more, that people

who wish to understand you can in a few hours sometimes hear quite enough to make

it a serious and real choice for them, whether they will accept or reject truth.

Afterwards also a Peon came, who took a Tamil tract about sin and death and

acknowledged together with the others present, that the &lt;-* ^ of the

first is death: who also is satisfied of the truth of Monotheism„±&gt;ut sounded

with curious precaution whether we only come to give to the people

or wish them to embrace our £ flS) • I said him^of^-course we give

first or light, but ther^for no other reason, than that people miqht

be enabled to form their own choice, and if they are really wise they will not

only see the new good things but eat them. But I said that of course I have

no power, no salary etc. which then was inquired into by them with much interest.

They also came to no decision about a school, but asked repeatedly whether we

intend to stay at Chittoor; so that there seems to be hope, they only want to have

more confidence in us in order to avail themselves of what was acknowledged

by themselves an offer for their best.

Monday, September 11th. Deep experience with Andrew. He demands Batta, although we for his

Whole household taken care of with me during the time of his trip and also food for him

had offered. He became very angry at the words I spoke of the love of money

dropped, and more than what I said, that his bad temper prevented him

have to preach Christ as fully as he might otherwise have done, still more

finally that I said that his anger and pride was his favorite sin after all

what Schaffter wrote to me. While I shed tears over my ge

feigned hope of having a friend in him as I did him through equality

throughout the journey had sought to prove - he went with Ramasami, the

Heiden as interpreter, to Groves and sued me as if I had given him miser

hot and would have given him a bad character. Certainly, us dust and ash

A bad character belongs to creatures, but praise the lamb. - The Lord strengthening

me, I overcame fear and unbelief, also by the ensample of my dear Br. Möqling and

began preaching on the Bazar of Chittoor. Many heard, took tracts, some also

could not but acknowledge the truth of our Savior's words. Distributing the

p* ^(Tg- /r i met a Roman Catholic, the petitioner

against Mr. Lascelles, from Pondicherry before his house, with whom I sat and

had a conversation first in Tamil then in French. It did strike me how far more

infecting the French tone is to natives and how far more perfectly they get

master of it than of the English. - Now Lord bless.

Tuesday, 12 September. Again on Bazar. The words of the sermon of the mount strike. A man called

all what I said of God a lie, because one sees him not, bringing no other reason.

I took the other men to witness, that none of them had seen the words which

just had escaped his mouth, that these therefore were all lies. - Spoke about

God's way of recommending his love to qs, taking Zalenius* example. 0 Lord, keep

me near to the word of thy own mouth, and to the name from which alone salvation

flows out. - Andrew having excused or rather defended himself in the morning, not

yielding a point, wrote in the afternoon a deprication, comparing himself with

the ru ^ n -xr~v~X. , - after having been given to

understand that he may choose to stand with us on a spiritual ground or to seek

elsewhere better worldly prospects. It seems he as also formerly the boys thought,

we could not dispense with them: but it makes one's hands indeed free, if one

can dispense with any thing besides the Lord. About this we read also in the

evening with the Lascelles (Mt 7) "strait and narrow path" - it is indeed not

lying on roses, that one enters to the gate or does any effective work in the king-

Dom of Christ. - I am still strengthened and cheered by Oehlers and

1837

Betulius Letters, arrived during my journey and read Saturday night (Sunday

in the morning I preached about faith, showed Bartimaeus what faith is).

Saturday, September 16th. Br. Groves brought Dean Drews from the London Society's bungalow to our

humble dwelling. It seems he feit in the beginning not so comfortable here, as

towards the end; Mrs. Dr[ew] liked to stay &lt;(she died February 1838 with 2 chil-

dren)&gt;. On Saturday evening he went with me to the Bazar, but qot entangled with

a scoffing brahmin.

Sunday, 17 September. I preached in Tamil (Mt 22) ... calling to the marriage supper and the 4/3

who are not chosen. I trust the Lord will haue made them to understand at least

something. Also Drew's seruants were present and many boys, his bearers, listened

to some words outside. - Dr[ew] preached at Bilderbeck's on our Lord's coming.

Afterwards conversation with him about Tamil language, studies, preaching, trans-

lating, profitable to me, I trust. In the evening he took also the Lord's supper

with us. - My going in the sun to Bilderbeck's chapel did put me in a feverish

state of health through some days of the following week. God's mercy did however

not let the sickness prevail. More trying and humbling than this weakness (through

which I feil asleep in the Thursday evening meeting 21 September) was the spiri¬

tual weakness which accompanied it and made me repeatedly to regard all Tamil

preaching at least from my mouth all but wind, lie and foolishness. I did not go

regularly to the Bazar, flesh and Satan lent excuses.

Saturday evening, 23 September. I was however really blessed in preaching, reading and convers-

ing on the Bazar. - The people heard and understood at least something: and

though a selfwise merchant ridiculed me, by lifting up a tract to hear whether

God would speak from it - and an old grey man told me "my labouring is in vain

and black people will not be changed, but smear ashes and cry Rama as before",

and went away stopping his ears, still some also heard willingly and asked of what

use these news are to them. - Evening miss[ion] meeting. Question whether the old

girl Isabella, whose father had been persuaded by monthly pay of 2 Rs to let

her go to Chittoor and who liked no more to obey for Caste reasons, should be

kept or for the best of school and Mistresses be left at freedom to go? Br.*

Groves led all to decide upon the latter. Susan, who has countenanced Isabell's

pride and also in other points was no t to the y° un 9 er yirls

was dismissed the school, and shall now probably haue to work in Mrs. Groves'

room. This will under God's mercy tend to keep the schoolgirls nearer to the

level on which Christ's humiliation has placed us all.

Sunday, 24 September, preached about the Brazen Serpent - far weaker and less to the point than

I had previously feit God's spirit working out the thought in me. 0 what a

perfect child I am yet to speak of Christ crucified. Lord mend this: let the

other things go. - Grieving occurrence between Archdeacon Harper - passing through

this - and Lascelles about preaching in the Prov[incial] Court! 0 bear with

us, good Lord!

Friday, 29 September. Had the mortification and comfort of a Palayankottai letter, comforting me

about Andrew's misgivings and giving a key to the conduct of poor poor Christian.

He wrote true and false complaints, why he does not like Chittoor: 1. no regulär

a? and not treated as proper ^ f 9 + (what I had neuer

promised to do), 2. not allowing them to go into th^/villages (true in the fore-

noon but gave them the time from 4 o'clock free), 3. that we, the Missionaries,

sit still and hope Churches will fly to us as in the Tirunelveli without our

1837

moving a finger (Lord thou knowst our - better, my - laziness! Part of this

complaint also is true - I move hardly one, 2 fingers and have a whole hand,

but still a bruised and wounded one; but I expect no Churches, but from thee

and the work of thy hand, and will - nimm mich beim Wort - will also first labour,

and suffer for it). If in a month no change should follow, he will join Bilderbeck

or go to Madras or to Tirunelveli. I told the whole to Br. Groves also that

Br. Müller wrote it seems the 3 had conspired for a regulär Opposition against us.

We immediately called the 3, read to Christ[ian] the contents of the letter, and

declared the connexion with him to be dissolved, left to the 2 others (of whom

Andrew had twice asked Sch[affter] for "a character") their choice whether they

will stay or not. Andrew and Vedamuttu humbled themselves: the latter knew noth¬

ing of the letter which Christ[ian] wrote, using "we", to David Pilley. Andrew

asked forgiveness for what has passed a month ago. Vedamuttu wished farther

instruction with cloth and eating. With the latter I was always more pleased

than with Christian's sometimes so flattering, sometimes so proud and vain be-

haviour. In the evening a letter from Christian came, well written, but what do I

know of the contents? He repents very well in words - as naturally as he wept

some weeks ago about my accusing him of hypocrisy.

Saturday morning (30 September) he came to ask for an answer to his letter. I told him what Br.

Groves thought about it: 1. that we forgive him, 2. but for this reason we are

not obliged to renew our superintendence over him. We shall write to Palayan-

kottai what Rh[enius] thinks best to be done to him. I really do not know whether

a Pariar life in his village will not do far better for him, than a learning

in order to appear something great.

Sunday, 1 October, preached of Christ's crucifixion according to Luke - the 3 crucified ones on

Golgotha. 0 that I had more persuasion of the words being really the Holy Ghost's,

that I might know more what a sword I wield. - Groves about 1 Petr touching

at people's calling. Christ a Blasphemer and Sabbath-breaker, much to the purpose:

as the Archdeacon in open Company had called Groves without specification a

preacher of blasphemous doctrines.

Monday, 2 October, evening left for the Arcot road. Came first to my last stage when travelling

from my* Madras. Nobody could or would read, hardly speak. Slept in the cart:

morning after breakfast walked to Narsingarowpetti, guarded by clouds, which

dropped also a little rain on us. Walking through the Bazar we found none who

would read, until at last ln the school a boy began to take a Telugu book, there

a conversation ensued: and after having returned to the Chattiram I had continu-

ally old and young around me, Telugus, but who spoke Tamil and could read their

language. The men understood me uncommonly well, having evidently a desire to

know something better than the fables about which they laugh. All my "Criticisms

on Schasters" went off, and I could have spent more, had I had them. Mr. Bilder¬

beck seems to have been here before, but only once as it appears. Andrew and

Christian had gone to Small Narsingapetti but had hardly found anybody who would

listen to them. Evening to Poonay. People entirely unacquainted with the name

of Jesus came into our reach. - Tracts went pretty well off (Tamil). We entered

also into a Tamil school of the villagers and had there some talk with the School-

master who looked rather suspicious on our giving books to his oldest boys.

Wednesday morning - after a strong nightrain to Melpatti: the day most delightful for walking.

The highcaste people there had never yet seen a Missionary in their village.

Many listened for a considerable time, said yes to the nothingness of their

IG

1837

idolatry and their ways and endeavours to obtaln salvation, but took only few

books. We saw then the Numbercaren, who with hls fellows had already heard of

Jesus in Arcot or elsewhere: but having to care for his office and getting money

by it he has not a bit of time to spare for reading our books. An old nice looking

gentleman was present who confessed that when invited to a marriagefeast they

had always time to spare: also the others looked a little up from their deis

and listened when I told them to what a marriagefeast we arg invited. They also

took at last some books. The Tirunelveli tracts in small 12 are especially

liked. - Evening - nearly all walking to Arcot , met on the &lt; a~a-JPC~ ^ x _

road an old Schoolmaster employed by Rhenius and Bilderbeck who believed that

the Holy Ghost has taken his abode in him, who also answered other questions

very satisfactorily; only there also was the Word (j, j (T*f &lt;-P before

and behind, in his talk both with me and Andrew. - Saw the 4 Germ[an] brethren's

house from afar: passed Church. Pellew called me himself into his compound,

as I just was doubting whether I am in the right. - Nice refreshing evening.

Dear Lieut. Walker came immediately over and stayed the evening with us. Before

he came, and whilst Pellew was in the lines I had free conversation with Mrs.

Pellew esp. on Mr. More's state of mind. I concluded from what she said that

one has to talk very cautiously with him as he hears and receives so very cau-

tiously. He would also not come over with W. according to his own explanation

"because he is often very curious" - (and had had some dreams). - Spoke a few

words on Hebr 9.10 about Christ's Highpriesthood. The Lord seems to have blessed

the recollection of it to dear Br. Walker. He really doubts whether More has

even heard so much as Christ's having offered himself for us as one perfect

sacrifice, able to perfect all who believe in it.

Thursday, 3 October. After a morning ride with Mr. and Mrs. P[ellew] we went over to W[alker]

and M[ore], I am sorry to see that for the present they seem not much furthered on

by their being together, as W[alker] can hardly get M[ore] to a confidential

conversation and then also presses perhaps many things too strongly on M[ore]'s

agitated mind. - The Tomes pretty cool, but kind. The Rev. Sir seems to begin

a critic of Gr.'s New Testament in the blood of Jesus by showing 1. that the

title is at all events wrong, as a testament, that is covenant, can never be

a rule, etc. - I heard that Dr. Scudder has distributed plenty of Luke's gospels

in Vellore and Arcot on his last passing through: but as they are bound people

endeavour to seil them again. May many at last come into proper hands. - Andrew

and Christian went into some bazar streets, found that Mr. Bilderbeck had been

repeatedly there, and people had considerable knowledge, knew of all the tracts

except the Palayankottai ones: so Arcot is not the place for us to go to. -

Walker and the Knox's came to dinner - it was a pleasant quiet evening. Mrs.

P[ellew] began a talk about being crucified with Christ (f.i. who loves father

and m[other] more than me, is not worthy of me). I proposed then Luke 23 which

we read and about which I spoke. The Knox's are much to be liked. They seem

deeply impressed with the truth. I also wanted to set before them that our faith

Stands not on doctrines, but on realities, facts which were then done . - Left

about 8 o'clock, Pellew walked with me yet a considerable distance and spoke

warmly and sincerely: seeing he is the Honourable P[ellew] what do we want much

other witness? - Reached Lalap[etti] on horseback; Andrew and Christian had

been there for 4 hours, and conversed much with people, who knew all something

(probably not only from Bilderbeck but also in Arcot from Rh[enius] etc. 11 and

liked the one God, but hated and feared so much as the name of Jesus. Therefore

Lalap[etti] also is to be counted Arcotground.

1837

11

Friday, 6 October morning. I left Lalap[etti] (after having obliged the Lascelles on their

way to Arcot to partake of my coffee) - was against my will carried so far as

Poonay; whereas I looked continually out for the village promised to be between

Melpaddi and Poonay. As it was already noon, I could not go into the village. The

bandi was very hot and the way had affected my headnerves. - In the evening

we stayed again not in a village near the road hitherto unvisited, as I had

desired it, but the bandi man etc. were again in Narsingapetti, wishing to stay

there throughout the night. I see from various experiences that even Andrew

has something like apprehension in going into any new village: all the natives

like to go to places where they have once formerly made a fire and bought rice

and found water near. I reproved them this time and went on - the sun was already

down, tili we came to Muttukur on the right hand the road, where old and young

passed by the topu we were in, in order to see the wise man and how he drinks tea.

The people are Telugus. After having passed the night in the bandi, we spoke with

them, but only a few would or could read, and there was a great deal of reserve

about them. We went to the village of Tamil Pariars on the other side of the topu.

There we got into freer conversation and they liked the idea of a school to be

established amongst them: confessed the foolishness of their worship and that they

are in utmost ignorance of the way of salvation. From thence to Uelcur

(Saturday, 7 October) where we stopped in the Chavadi (kind of occasional office for men of

business, generally serving for Chattiram). The people came soon round me, took

Telugu books and spoke of the onehanded &lt;4 who had seen them

before (Mimmo) and also spoken^of Jesus. He hacWfiven 10 Rs to a man, who regarded

this as great 4j ' *) CO for the missionary &lt;dV\ere had, spent

plenty of money/among them&gt;, so we got into talk about Q&gt; &amp; ^ v' j

^ ^ _^ and I explained them the true proportion of a gift

pleasing to God, and also the royal way in which God gives to us not alms but all

the fullness of Deity. - People listened well and with some reverence: At last

their fcuru came: a Roman Guru would not have borne so patiently what we said

about the blind guiding a blind. We warned all the people of him and had long

talk with himself about what is truth - even that which came down from heaven.

When we called their stone idols lifeless he had the curious idea, to say, that

still there is fire in it, and where fire is there is also life: this led me to

explain to him the difference between those various powers of life diffused

through all creation and between that indissolvable life, which is God's existence

according to his own will. This is actus purissimus, &lt; 2t&gt; &gt; a -H ^he

other passive, comparatively will-less - but the latter I did not teil him; but

simply that God is everywhere, but has chosen to himself a peculiar dwelling

place in heaven to which Christ is way and ladder. He to be known and found by

prayer. He could not understand how God talks with us, and I would not explain it:

saying it was like the taste of something new (I showed him bread) if I would teil

him much of this taste he would still not perfectly understand me, but if eating

himself he would know it. Thus we went on, gave our last Telugu books - and

one or 2 Tamil ones (a Teluguschool is in the village, no Tamil one). At last

the children of the Brahm. School there came, sang and played before me tili my

ears nearly bürst and pressed a present out from me. Evening arrived in Chittoor

in good health (a copra capell* [couple?] had just been killed in my room).

Donnerstag, 12. Oktober. Gr[oves] gab mir den Bericht von Möglings Ordination und Kapffs 2tem

Advent Christi, die wohl viele Monate zuvor ausgesandt wurden und jetzt unter

altem Papier sich fanden, in die Hand. Das war ein Fest, unerwartet, spät nachge¬

holt. Ich bin und bleibe eben doch Schwabe; o Gott, möge ich nur der Welt, auch

der schwäbischen, täglich entrinnen.

Friday, 13 October. Susan was found out in a texture of lies - had said to Andrew, one wanted

her to take over Chatties to the Dayschool and because she would not do it,

was sent off the school - had taken a jacket of Isabelle, said first it was

Isabelle's, then - she gave it, then I took it, then - is not Isabelle's but

Andrew's- It was found out afterwards she had not taken it, but told the Ayah

for

taken it. I told her after the wish of Mrs.

Groves that we think her for the present worse than a heathen. I told Andrew

that his preaching and praying is all a farce, as long as he has not yet ordered

his house - all the compound people despise the name of Christ for such reasons.

Here ist faith and patience, hoping, where nothing is to be hoped. - A week's

labour on the Bazar and (in Sandapetti School) etc. is over - o Lord, who has

heard thy report and to whom is thy arm revealed? Be with me, that I may not

stand so lonely, so weakly, so full of doubt and a hard unbelieving hard [heart?]

- but that I may thank thee for the white harvest and reap with the sword of

thy Spirit. 0 risen Lord, heav/enly King, for more gifts from thee, from on high,

that I may not grov/el longer at this poor dying rate, but live and repand life.

0 let not Satan laugh and triumph over me, nor the men who hear me be deceived

by his instruments among them and their smooth words, but be with thy word,

in my mouth, that some at least may stick like nails. I want Christ, and they

want Christ: o may I revolve thy name more in my heart and on my lips, than

they do with Hari and Rama and Siva. Bless also the books, and bring those near

me, who really seek salvation. I would ask for many inquirers, for many brethren

to come, but because of my own weakness I will only say - one o Lord, one who

takes thy cross on himself, and dies, rises, ascends, lives, dwells and serves

with thee* one in whom I can rely and who may stir myself on in my poor work.

- Christian is received upon the clear understanding that he has now not to

hope for any money, nor even for an office at the end, but that he may learn

and after a year go back to Tirunelveli. - I am disquieted in my mind whether

I shall as heretofore spend so much with the 2 youths alone. Lord show what

I have to do. -

Division in Chittoor about God's word, originating in Mrs. Onslow on the one

side and her sister Mrs. Brett on the other - Mr. Casamajor, influenced by B[rett],

zealous for the law, writes to Madras he shall not support any Mission connected

with Groves - great loss!! Only for more faithfulness in our closets, and though

many things would grieve, they would only grieve us for the sake of those who

are losers by it. For really we are the gainers by what ever God sends us. -

Mrs. van Sömeren died 14 October in the bungalow at Vencatagherry.

Saturday, 21. John Groves arrives.

Sunday, 22 October, finished a number of sermons on Christ's death, resurrection, ascension,

and Pentecost. How much seed was there in it? The question, how much of it will

spring up, is taken out of my hand and is now thine.

Monday, 23. Andrew met me when going to the Bazar, and asked me to take him along. So I did,

for the first time. - Mr. and Mrs. Groves went with Lascelles to Palmaner, where

the purchase of a Missionary bungalow is contemplated.

Wednesday, 1 November. The rains have set in with might. When walking with Andrew to the Lascelles

he confessed how so he thinks that Susan is not yet converted (she is in a

continual falsehood system in order to avoid doing work) and that he often repents

of his marriage. She is too lazy to do even the most necessary things for him.

1837

13

In a conversation with Frau Lascelles she said to me in a motherly manner: I was closed

alone, should marry. Instead of an excuse, I told her outright why

I'm waiting. I am saddened by what I learned of Grove's 2nd marriage through this

Medium, by H. Gr. and GL hear that Fr. G. is through A.-N.* G.

pleading felt compelled to descend from their higher rank,

and accept his hand. Your non-humiliation brings a lot of hardship

Haus. Armer Gemahl.

12 and 19 November, Sundays. Visits of a Palicot nominal Christian. The latter day I told him

plainly, that though he has received outward baptism and some instructions,

his want of the firelike inward baptism makes his punishment only somewhat harder

than that of a heathen. He confessed that there is no communion with Jesus about

him. - Also as other interesting inquirer. Men who wish to become schoolmasters

begin to learn with me: at present 3,4. My great fear of quarrels with B. nearly

fulfilled, he lying according to the Spirit that is in him, as if we and Mrs.

Lascelles gave rupees to draw people over. - This was spoken of 27 November

when in the evening Lascelles Casamajor met without knowing of each other here.

Bilderbeck seems to be afraid of losing his church, and likes therefore to believe

stories of his catechist.

20 November. A regulär evening meeting in Tamil and English begun with Mrs. L[ascelles] and

the natives around us. Oh for more spirit into our willing, but weak forms. -

Have 3 schoolmasters learning^with me for their schools' best - but they do

it for ^«-P v/ i&gt;^r sake. Bless also this, father of all the Spirits

and thou Son who hast bought these all with thy own heart's blood. - I see daily

that what I want and lack most is that patience, which made our Lord a perfect

highpriest, and without which none can be an ‘-kw.koS as Paul wishes all Bishops

to be. And I still pretend to aspire after the office if not the name of a Pastor.

If thou givest me a church, it will prove that I aspire not with my natural

heart, but according to the mind of thy Spirit. £t TYj €T(fft&lt;orroc.s

Saturday, 2 December (Ludwig 1 s birthday). I found out that the Sandapetti Schoolmaster, already

teacher in dear d'Aere's time understands not yet the most simple questions

about Scripture. I therefore shall try to get all the Schoolmasters Saturday

afternoon together to have thorough conversation with them, and to keep them

continually learning. - The Lord helps me evidently to come down to the simple

talk of the natives. - With regard to the English preaching God's interference

is manifested in dear Mrs. Onslow's whole-heart-conversion, in her distress

both with regard to sister and husband; but also they seem to think it a real

thing what beforehand they had so entirely despised. Mr. Brett spoke out very

decidedly and with pretty clear looks what he seeks in Christianity, on Wednes-

day, 29 November (when we drank tea with Mr. Casamajor and I came to sit near

Mrs. Brett). 0 Lord carry on this work and have especially to dear Br. Groves

the hands free for a full and uncurtailed missionary ministry.

Friday, 1 December. 2 Brahmins humbled me on the Bazar more than I had ever experienced before,

I spoke of love of ^ tr+vT cs , they showed then how wicked Hindu black man

is for seeking i/ &lt;*&gt;, and how wise and good the great white man, who

seeks not ^ &lt;rc£&gt;but ^ - etc., etc. Such exercise will

be necessary and wholesome for a heart so proud and impatient as that in my

breast continually manifests itself to be.

Monday, 4 December. Iruvaram school begun. Mrs. Lascelles' love prepared me a fear and 7 people

came, wishing for instruction and baptism. Now Lord guide me, that I guide none

astray , and myself walk in straight paths.

Tuesday, 5 December. On the evening, when Onslows and Bretts intended the first time to go to

the evening reading at Groves's, I left on the V/ellore road, reached first the

village I was in 9 September. As it was dark already I made haste to address

the people under the great village tree. Had again as the last time rather

interesting conversations,though they are chiefly Telugus and know hardly to

read. We have a God who talks with us - well said they, ours never talk. We

have a God, who loves all - they not: one whom we love - they not. I preached

especially 2 things, of whose meeting in God I said, the heathen have no conception

- God's wrath and his love. Showed how they meet in Christ's face, but weakly!!

They asked when I shall come again. - After tea I took a walk through the whole

village, but nobody to be seen, all inside houses. The few I met would not take

tracts, I made the ronde a second time, then I called a man in one of the last

houses out, found he was one who had rather willingly inquired and gladly took

a few tracts. Now may they be a seed which brings fruit in its season! - Christian

runs now always after me, though I prefer to go alone. He speaks hardly a Word,

but wishes to appear - or to be - what do I know - in love with me. I had spoken

seriously with both on the road. For as I had long observed their coolness against

each other, I now thought it necessary to teil them that all their being not

satisfied with things as they are, arises from their mutual want of love. Asked,

why they love not each other, found out more and more, that Vedamuttu distrusting

Christian (for his tongue's sake it appears) does no more talk with him. I put

the question so distinctly that they had either to say, one thinks the other

to be no Christian or that I had to say, I think none of them a Christian: because

they (viz. Vedamuttu) had declared the breach incurable except by Separation.

But I think seriously of the latter. Told at all events both, that for their

sake I was so slack in administering the Lord's supper in Tamil.

Wednesday, 6 December. Morning again to Pallur. After breakfast went into the village (NB the

Choultry-peon told me of Mr. Bilderbeck's having been here on his last journey

and having inquired after my transactions here and in the villages about. May

the Lord give me grace to make the best use of the many who lie in wait about

us, or watch us). The people understood not to read. I was carried to the Chetti

who allowed me to enter into his house and sit on the ground. Told what Christ

had done for us, wishing to pay all our sins, if we will have them paid. Again

excuses for not understanding - but some things surely they understood. Took

a Telugu tract, and laid it to the other the Peon had given him. The people

both laughed and listened around me, according to their fashion. At last he

said - pongel [gehen Siel] - and so we went. - After dinner to Bammasamudram,

rather a long round about walk, which however had much that pleased from the

aspect of the large lake and the people working at and near it, as well as the

fresh breeze which came from it. It was no more that intense heat of the last

time. The valley then so dry now one watersheet. When I had arrived in the village

and spoke with the people, amongst whom only a Brahmin woman had courage or

Tamil enough to talk freely with me, I saw Chrfistian] standing near me, though

I had not called him after me. I said nothing, though I sometimes feel my throat

very narrow when he stqnds near me, and pleases me with every member of his hpdy

and soul. - The people of the first village sent us to the ^*^ 4 / *

y7 kjp sU? , where the Retti is. With him we had conversations^"and he being

acquainted with Greenpetti and Chittoor, thought seriously of the offer of a

1837

13

school - but with Sudra master - although he dryly remarked, that in this village

it was not mamul, and that all the children have other work. He promised to

see me in Chittoor. Few tracts. - Evening Vellore; passed the fort when the

last red clouds were reflected by the broad full fort ditch (there are said

to be crocodiles in). Passed the night in the bungalow.

Morning 9 o'clock to Capt. Ottley fortadjutant who expected me from a note I had sent him before-

hand. C.G.P. I found him playing guitar, which seems to be his hobby. Pictures

all around, girls, horses, hunting, books besides Shakespeare, Byron, and Ovid

Art to love. Only Musik and about Horsescience. A man to be known at the first

look. After I had heard a long piece on guitar, and heard of Marjoribanks great

"fortune" having left to him by his father 50 000 £, we went to the fort. Large

stonemasses, built in a nice taste. Col. Stewart laconic but kind. Fortschool,

built in the manner of large Granit-chattrams. On one side the girls whom a white

lady taught Scriptures. The schoolmaster of the boys I soon found to be a pious man

from the intelligent answers the boys gave on Scriptural guestions. I heard also that

he is an undefatigable man. - The lady was Mrs. Bisset, as Ottley oddly says: "worth

100s of her husbands." As the examination was finished (at 12) Mrs. Bisset left

for home. So did I, but Ottley drove me first to Capt. Awdry who had invited

him and me to dinner. He was not at home, only Mrs., who is it appears yet far

from the light, which I hear her husband lately received frightened by disease

(made up a quarrel with Ottley, thinking his last hour come). Nice forward

children. Then to Bissets. He evidently much pressed down: his wife though

suffering in her health very cheerful with the little girl on her lap. His

first question was, whether Gr[oves] is not much opposed to the army. I laughed

and explained, but soon feit, what Ottley confirmed, that he feels himself very

uncomfortable as officer and in consequence may be afraid of Gr[oves]'s view

being correct. Then about Chittoor. I told her who daily visits the girls of

our girlschool, in which she was much interested. "B[ilderbeck] that delightful

Missionary" - "Casamajor, who helps so much to the kingdom - whether he gives

also to us?" - This I explained according to truth, but nothing about B[ilderbeck].

At last lively conversation about party spirit: I telling much of the state

of the German church, its enemies and persecutors, and the love kindled thereby

- which pleased Capt. Bisset evidently. Still he did not ask for Gr[oves]'s

coming: she seems to be without fear rather desiring it. Tomes has frightened

him,as Ottley teils me. - I told Mrs. Bisset much of our doings. She offered

handshaking when parting. Ottley remarked that both she and I have feit union

in our "ideas": she is evidently preaching by her quiet amiable conduct sermons

twice as powerful as her busband of whom Ottley says, that he cannot bear his

canting always Jesus Jehovah and repeating it 200 times over like the names

of a Hindu god. - 3 o'clock dinner at Awdrys'. Col. Stewart and Wilson (very

old, talks always of promotion) with 2 captains more besides P. and 0. and their

respective ladies made the party. I was requested to ask a blessing. But not

a bit of nice talk, so much that I doubted whether I had been invited for Ottley's

sake, or because Awdry wished to make our acquaintance. A great deal of money

talk (about Palmaner house. 950 Rs. Onslow wrote that morning an answer fr[om]

babyton). After dinner walked in the garden (heard here that Lascelles by

carrying official things with too high on hand a quarrel with the master of the house

had, only in letters, the one against Lascelles resolution of the

entailed high authority. That saddened me. Heard in passing from Ottley,

that Lascelles wished to make amends). Then exit with Ottley, the Gro[oves]

upholds, perhaps driven in spirit to seek something better than he has.

Because he considered us too holy, I lifted the veil from my own

sündigen Natur. - At home met a letter from Collector Huddlestone in Madras,

16

1837

who after having lost his wife, writes that he thinks he shall soon die too

suddenly and follow his adorable wife and sent already his music to Ottley.

He then showed me the letter of Huddlestone wherein he announced her death.

That led to conversations on the misery of man in his natural state without

hope or God and gave me a welcome help to speak as strong as possible of what

alone gives peace in God. He confessed much - wishes to have Gr[oves] "though

his house is not worthy to receive him" - promises also all help from Col. Stewart

towards it. So I hope he will go. - The conversation was so welcome to me that

I postponed my going tili morning

(Friday, 8 December) when I first went to Christianpetti a Roman Catholic village, the last

place in the Vellore valley towards Chittoor. They are Telugus from Punganoor*.

Speak Tamil little. Carried me to their Church, said yes to my exhortations,

and wondered that we have just the same things in our \/edam as they in theirs.

They look at all events happier than heathens - but wish still for more money,

and though they acknowledge they have enough will spare nothing for a school.

(I hear that the LMS Cat[echist]s in Vellore speak almost only with Roman

Catholics, not with heathens - from fear. The Priest teils his people to hear

these Catechists as the only difference between their and our creed is about

worshipping images. This appears liberal and is at all events not much risked,

because he knows that none will have a doubt as to the propriety of idols. Also

my bandicaren acknowledged this in conversations with Ottley's horsekeeper,

a Roman Catholic, that our V/edam the Luz vedam, is worth nothing, because there

is no Ou» d" am ^ n or i n ~ After breakfast, to

Nararipetti, where we arrived at 12. Went first to Vasapalli, where I found

that people remembered what I had told them, some liked to hear and talk more,

asked about consequences of this marcam both for them and for me and received

a free answer. They say if the Retti receives it, they would also. I showed

how foolish such a talk is. But the Retti was rather angry when I told him the

same and was glad when after I had tried to get tracts for all the reading people

in the village I marched off. - In the village near the road again as beforehand

driven away by obstinate silence and deafness.- The same in the Retti village

near the bungalow.

Saturday, 9 December, early morning to Rettigonda where I had breakfast. In the house near us

people ran from all sides. A girl had been seized by a devil ((?u ff~a ft?

but from fear the[y] call it only S ) ~ they got then

a man, who by a mightier devil will drive out the weaker one. I thought again,

how nice it would be if I could just help them with the name of Jesus, for Veda¬

muttu had already entered the village and heard, that nobody could (or would)

read. People appeared to me also nearly inaccessible. Still I went after breakfast

into the village, and met a man in his little compound who knew our books from

Madras. Also an old Sepoy and others were present who have no fear to hear and

to converse. As many Hindus, so this man also believe[s] that there is only one

God and by saying cf* to him we will be saved. I pointed out to him

how wrong these conclusions were: and showed him that we first want pardon for

our sins before we can praise God: and then how the praise ought to be not with

lips only, but with the whole heart and all members. He seemed to like the proposal

of a school and will propose it to the other vi.llagers, who in concequence of

Greenpetti's example will see no great obsticle in the way.

10*. After leaving the village, we got yet another big man to take a Telugu tract.

Monday, 11 December. Told today Christian that he has to leave us, and wished him to go back

to Tirunelveli. The dissension between him and the other had come to such a

hight that he could no more longer stay with us. The servants already knew it

and in part also the reasons (Fleischeslust, ausgesprochen gegen Susanne und

alle die übrigen - nebenbei Unredlichkeit im Wegnehmen kleiner Bücher von uns

- und alles das heißt er noch immer ^^^^^^ # K , j)y fzT^T )•

It's something heavy for me, but I can't/change it&gt; Lord, carry with you

him and make him something good when he converts!

- Lascelles's waterwoman seems converted.

Thursday December 14th. Christian zu Bilderbeck..- Bilderbeck wrote me a note, himself

inquiring about Christian. I didn't answer in detail <1 pointed out a

lie in his application that I took him for help, did not eriguire into V[edamuttu]'s

complaint said* ... helper* is no more required&gt;, but I spoke of lust for money

and sins of the tongue, said that for Christian's sake I died the particulars

not wanting to mention his distance, also said why we wish he

would return to Tirunelveli and declared in any case that we would

having found no ecclesiastical office fit &lt;pharisian pride, underhand

dealings, sins of tongue, ... of money&gt;. He told Brett Gundert got him

wrote a short rough note, no answer, just flat out, if you will

take him take him. 0 devil, how you take your delight in dishonoring the hoch¬

holy Christian name!

Monday, December 24th. Supper with Fr. ünslow and Bretts by* Tomes, who were also Knoxs

currently. This is the first time I've done it the CE* way, um

to counter the annoyance.

25 December. Last Supper in Tamil with Andrew, Vedamuttu, Samson in my room. Samson is

a Christian converted by Mr. Laidler in Bangalore 10 years ago, present

Pelew's servant. - We were happily together; and I envied the big one

Lot not (Lase., Gr., Onsl., Br., Knox, Walker, Pellew, and families), the

I had left with the Lascelles. size asked Mrs. P. to give up her servant

to our establishment, but although P. had offered it to Mr. G. and me, Mrs. P.

and therefore it seems also our Lord would not agree.

Sunday, December 31, preached on Baal and Jehovah. Younger Walker, br[other] of the Bangalore

Walker stood with us. A good soul plagued with something dogmatic

Prophetism picked up by brother and some boastful doubts

regarding Eatalism. He gave me a gold chain for Rhenius. Would have

January 1, 1838 night a long conversation with him, wished him sin sinful and Jesus

to make lovable.

Wednesday, January 3, baptized (Ramayen) Lazarus on his bed, as he wished it so much before

his death by consumption. He says he believes in Christ, Lord, then give him

Thy Holy Spirit.

Friday, 5 January. Capt. Chalmers with Mrs Smith and a child passed through. This whole

week Miss Emma Groves lay down - with ailments that the inadvisability

unmarried female mission workers seem to prove. you and julie

had a fight, one thought the other was everything but a woman, and she be¬

doubted the Christian sense of the others. Poor Frank has with himself-

Promises and then denials do no good. He writes from Portonovo,

that he is learning Tamil. Emma pities me: and now she pities Mrs. Groves too, has

Julie to atone for the comparisons.

Sunday January 7th. Last supper in the bungalow with the Tanjore-Ayah, her brother, the Christenbe¬

swearer John and Compagnie.

Monday 8 January went to Ventamalai with Vedamuttu on the way to Gudiyattam. Vedamuttu

asked me why I gave offense to some people by calling Christ bridegroom. Would have

in the evening long conversation with him about T[irunelveli] and headcatechists there

himself. Heard of Samuel's adultery, the chief catechist's cunning, Savori

Muttu* lies, Muttu Sami's faithless and unfaithful nature and was deeply saddened.

O Lord, test and cleanse the work there, but do not destroy it. andrew

do not wish to return to Tirunelveli, the Chief Catechists and Rhenius

because of any catechist transfer. V[edamuttu] sees it very clearly,

how necessary equality, especially in salary, is for Christians. you have in

Tirunelveli still too much of a fear system, and that doesn't let full love

come up. Lead us on the right path.

Tuesday, 9 January. Walked in the morning very early to Pardarami, 10 natich. from Chittoor,

a nice way through a long Palmira forest. In the village people were astonished

at my coming, as it was something quite new and so nobody would confess that

he knew reading, nor talk. Still, one of the men talked a little and to him

I said what we want besides our earthly occupations. He also repeated the common

saying, if you teil no lie how will you get on in life. Whilst walking through

the village, met a Tuluker school. There were boys in without the fear of the

old ones. One ran at once and showed me a thing which reminded me of marketdays

in my childhood - a common Nürnberg Dial, the use of which he wanted to know.

I showed it to him and wrote the Hindostanee numbers at the side of the Romish,

by which he was greatly delighted. From the village I walked to the Southern

half of it. There some devil's dancers were showing their God and drummed, danced,

sang and conjured before him. People again told lies in order not to be questioned.

However when I was just parting after all had refused the Lord heard yet my

prayer, that he may not suffer my visit to this village, to be entirely useless,

and sent out of the last house (near the bungalow) a Tamil man who by his

confident open looks seemed rather to ask for a tract than to wait for being

asked. Whilst he heard my explanation also others gathered around and thought

it rather a good work of me to walk about in order to teil these things! So

I gave some tracts, Telugu and Tamil. If I had Marashta tr[acts] the counting

people would be glad to receive some. - From Pardarami in the evening to

Callapadi. The way leads at first through a rieh highground, full of water and

ricefields. I took V[edamuttu] into the bandi and read with him the English

tract concerning Jerusalem and the Jews. After that we were obliged to separate,

as the way became extremely trying for the poor animals. It leads through pleasant

jungles over a low arm of the Ghauts* (called Pardarami Pass). The descent is

very steep and hardly anything like road. Pretty tired we arrived after sunset

at Callapadi, 3 nat from Pardarami, a very large village hanging on the side

of a rocky mountain. At the entrance is a topu of Banian and other trees, full

of monkies. We went to the Chavadi (a poor place), then into the village. The

men were mostly gone. Still there were 2 in the lower part of it, who liked

to hear and took tracts for their school. The annunciation of God's fatherly

love and the whole business we came for appeared to the one so new, that he

could not help laughing aloud for astonishment. The other, an elderly man, was

rather interested in our Statement and will read the books attentively. Einge¬

wickelt in Kleider, schlief ich auf dem Boden und träumte, ich sitze an meines

from

Wednesday, 10 January. Soon after daybreak to Gudiyattam

C[allapadi], learned half barefoot on the way of the tight shoes and sore feet

walk. The town north of the river, with ruins of an old fort, is very extensive.

This we passed and lodged in one of the 3 bungalows beyond the riverbed. After

breakfast went to the bazarstreet of the Southern part and had rather an

encouraging reception. After some preaching in the Street a man invited me to

sit in his bazar on a beanbasket, and another took his place before me and so

amongst a great crowd he carried on a talk with me, very kind and obliging though

he called me , only complaining about my eating beaf. I said I have not

done it for more than a year, and to oblige him I might leave it off entirely:

but showed why it was no sin, as God had given all creatures into man's hands.

But said he, the Shastrams, I asked who they were by. He said from Brahma. So

I reminded him of Brahma's lie: and said shortly to a God who once has told

a lie I have not to believe any farther. This appeared most reasonable to all.

I told him then of that God who teils no lies, and of his incarnation not as

fish, which only can interest fishes, nor as pig nor as tortoise, but his coming

into man's flesh for man. One man seemed to understand what I said of sin being

born with us as a seed, and growing with years tili the bürden of it seems to

be beyond bearing. Explained also what birth from above is and told of the sower's

parable. All Tamil tracts I had taken along were taken. Also some Telugu ones.

The counting people would take Mahratta ones. ^ ** ^ 0^/*/ &lt;3^ would be a

desirable present to one of the Brahmins. - In the afternoon about 10 came to

me in the bungalow, asking for more tracts. The one who remembered having seen

me on the Ch. Bazar, complained about our reviling their Gods in our tracts,

calling them liars etc. I said that we do not call them so, nor did Christ ever

speak of their Gods; it is only their own books which deride their Gods. I told

him then how these ideas of lying and adulterous Gods arose, even from forming a

God after fallen man's nature and justifying them by the wickedness of this

nature. I farther explained why we teil them some words of this blind way, that

they may become afraid of farther progress on it and hear more readily of any new

way offered. Read then several things from Luke's gospel and explained, several

hearing attentively. A big schoolmaster asked for the gospel, saying he would teach

it to his 100 children. At last I was obliged to part with all the gospels I had.

This is the first visit of this kind, and with people who understand Tamil well.

These are the first gospels also I gave on my excursions. - Went evening again

into the large Bazarstreet and was invited by some Tamiler and Moslems to sit down

in their shop. The crowd round us was so great that I feit nearly suffocated by

dust and heat. They were very inguisitive - mentioned again the proceedings

of Government and the administering of oaths in courts as justifying their idola-

try. Another said that God gave one way to each caste - others disallowed this.

Again one asked me which caste of all that exist is the greatest, expecting I

would say the Europeans. But I told him that there are only 2 castes, a natural

one and one of birth from above and that from above is the more exellent. Life,

4 .

20

1838

death, sin, immortality were also spoken of. The Moslem were kinder and more -

if I may say - on one scale and one voice with the Hindus than anywhere eise I

saw. Old and young nearly rent* me for tracts. - (With regard to the Mohammedans

Vedamuttu teils me that they are always more one with the Hindus, where there are

no Europeans. The pride of the latter seems to induce them to draw a greater

line of demarcation between themselves and their former subjects).

Thursday, 11 January. Went in the morning early across the river to Vaniapettei (or Vannarpettei).

Part of the people were afraid to take tracts, because one cried they will make

all to be of one Vedam, and because I instead of denying it, expressed my joy

that he sees the reasonableness of this. In passing through the streets people

gathered round us on 2 occasions, to whom we preached the one thin^ necessary

in different ways. The second troop consisted chiefly of Brahmins , one of

whom spoke a little English and took an English tract. To them I told the pro-

phecies about what will stand at last and what will fall. They were a little

ashamed, but not yet angry, perhaps because the thing was new to them. I com-

forted them also that for the present the Comp[agnie] pays yet for their childish

plays and that therefore no violence is to be feared from us, but that the Lord

in his own time will make to fall what has no foundation. One asked what I meant

by the statement that there is no true love amongst them, which I explained,

taking the stature of Christ's love, even that of venturing one's life in order

to save. Here also many tracts went off. It is new year's day with them and

Pongalfeast. - After breakfast several men, also plenty of Canarese came to

fetch tracts. - Canarese tracts will soon be required. Amongst the Tamulians

there was a young man in 1818 in Madras, knew of Rh[enius] and was in Sawyer's

school. His name Muttusami. - He has still a Matth, gospel in his house, does

not well understand it, wishes to learn more: but has never accustomed himself

to work with his hands and seeks therefore a place with a Turei. He was quite ready

to go with me and follows perhaps afterwards. &lt;A Doctor passing through 10 days

ago had spoken Hindustanee to the people&gt;. People went on visiting tili sunset,

until tracts and nearly also my tongue failed; there were low cast, Brahmins,

Telugus, also a Conjeeveram Panderam who spoke conceitedly of wisdom. Some said

it would be well if I would stay yet longer: and I am satisfied the visitors

would have been more with every day. They already were very courageous, because

they were not kept in strict bonds as with other Tureis, sat unasked into chairs,

asked for pens, some looked after all my things, boys wanted a bit of fine paper,

others wanted to see my handwriting in Tamil etc. - Night talk

with Vedamuttu, in which he related the danger in which carnal lusts led him

bring, namely, that he often wishes he had never known Christ, dear, and

meet in old age. I got pretty close to him with the Bible through God's grace

comfort.

Friday, 12 January. Morning to Callakadi, stayed in the Chavadi. People after their £/ru do a&gt;

was over, came repeatedly in crowds: but the end still was that sin is dear

to them. They regard it as a favourable epoch for their village that again a

Turei visits it. The Schoolmaster wanted a "slate" - was 14 years ago with a

Mr. Kohl (Kohloff) in Vellore (from Tiruchirapalli) who told him nothing of

Christ but gave English spelling books, a bible etc. which all were burnt with

his house. He also perhaps comes to Chittoor. I am struck with the observation

that one or the other accident in my first coming to a village imparts a certain

character to my whole reception; where for instance one has made the beginning with

saying he does not read all follow in pretending not to know it and stop their ears

with one accord. Where once fear is overcome, you gain nearly immediately a certain

letters. Schaffter to B. about Ch. Chapman for letters.

1838

21

ascendancy over them and they feel as if they had got a protector more. - After

dinner passed the mountains for Pardarami, where I had a pretty long conversation

with the Telugus in the Southern village. They thought our way to be the

^7^ ff tr-Tß-c U&gt; ff % -&amp;&gt; laughed at their Gods, confessed that they

like sin and that for this reason they do not like our talk. - I hope if we

come a second time they will not reject us so shortly as they had done last

Tuesday.

Saturday, 13 January. Morning early to V/endamur, where I drank coffee and sought conversations

with the Brahmins and the Comedier of the place. But they hear so much of the

Greenpetti sermons that they rejected books most impudently. Having made our

ronde through the village I found at last a man who took our last Telugu and a

Tamil tract. The low cast with whom I spoke and who seem rather intelligent,

wished for a school; but whether the highcast will not oppose it, time must

teach. Arrived at 8 morning in Chittoor. - Here there had been visits from the

Dobbs.

Wednesday, 17 January. Lieut. Boswell and Mylne passing through with their regiment from Bang[a-

lore] to Samulcottah, nice young Christians.

Saturday, 20 January. Mutters Todestag. Baynes arrived from Bombay. Augustus Oakes guest.

21 January. Brett und Augustus Oakes bei des Herrn Abendmahl.

22 January. Susans Vater Mariadasen und Br. Mose nehmen sie auf Besuch für ihre Entbindung hinweg.

Saturday, 27. Lazarus died morning 1 o'clock, the name of Jesus on his lips : buried in the

afternoon.

Thursday, 25. Was in ; people are ready to give a schoolplace; altogether

a nice spot, central and yet untrodden. 0 for more Spirit!!

Wednesday, 24. Major Purton arrived here, in order to stay. He has not suffered himself to be

frightened by the warnings he got in Madras concerning these unsettlers. But

his little wife wishes to be kept in the Ch. of E.

Tuesday, 30 January. Miss Groves departs for Madras (warum? die Leute lügen, es ist wegen Johns

Abreise, im Grunde ist's Groves jüngerer Sohn).

Thursday, 1 February. Baptized Fr. Lascelles waterwoman in the evening. She is a joy to me and

a great comfort, showing what the Lord may make out of such baby.

Sunday, 4 February. Bin 24 Jahr alt, der Herr segne mich nicht bloß mit Jahren, sondern Wachstum

am Geist.

Monday, 5 February. Abends nach Cottapalli. Went to one of the next houses, where I spoke with two

men. They say they are satisfied with their Sawmi because he is a Shottusami: and

although there is only one God, you want many just as you want salt, rice, brimjoal

and other things for dinner. He laughed at what I said.

Tuesday, 6 February. Walked in the morning to Pallur, where we arrived with sunrise. The man

in the Choultry said yes to everything I said. Passed in the afternoon Christian-

petti where I entered and perceived several men sitting in a large house. We

went near, it seems to be the Roman Catholic Catechist's house. So I entered. The

books I offered, none would read, all being kept under a kind of charm, tili

22

1838

the most intelligent looking of them began to talk. He carried on a dispute

on the differences between Protestant and Roman Catholic, called our Vedam one

made 300 years ago - spoke about Luther's having permitted double marriage to

one of his princes, about saints, images, Submission and belief in gurus, celibacy,

regeneration by water and spirit, bible translations - he got several times

very angry; the people were very friendly and seemed to respect my remaining

always calm and speaking only scriptural words. He asked why I enter, said it is

not necessary - it will be d[h]armam to go to heathens as the Brahmins in a

neighbouring villagp are, but they being Christians want me no more. I appealed

to Paul's wish that everyocje should exhort the other and warn of the devil's

snares - he spoke of the ^ ) &lt;zrC - u) who troubles the sheep, took no books

nor did he allow to takevexcepcthe Priest permitted, wanted me to speak rather

with Owunor* etc. to which I said in reply that the gospel is preached to the

poor and least to rieh monopolists. He obliged me at last to leave. He seems

intelligent and well instructed in his way, arrived at sunset in Vellore where

in entering I met a man who formerly had visited me in Chittoor and now expressed

his surprise in seeing me walking in. He is interesting but still smears ashes.

Camerer also told me that he spoke with him, that he allows catechists and white

people to enter into his house: but still talks so much of the insignificance

of outward things compared with inward. - When I came to Capt. Ottley's house

he was not at home, but at Capt. Perreau's. When he came wished he me to go

to this gentleman who had kindly invited me; because Ottley's house was filled

with Madras visitors (Mrs. Worcester). Ottley appears as weak and worldly as

before: there are some Christian books among horse- and other scientific works. -

At Perreau's I met the whole evening with poor young officers, in whose talk

nothing was remarkable but the witness they gave to the decisive piety of Mrs.

Bisset. She is indeed like a shy gazelle, appearing to be always afraid of a

devil, but no doubt endeav/ouring to do right in ev/erything according to her

judgment and ability. - Perreau was very kind and obliging, walking on sticks,

because he had twice broken his legs. With me he put on the coat of formal Scot-

tish religion, and feit annoyed by the profligate talk of his companions.

Wednesday, 7 February, morning early I wrote to Kohl who on his part wished me to come to his

house. So I walked over and saw him and Camerer, remained also with them tili

12. Kohl explained the misunderstanding he had caused, hopes now to become a

good neighbour, relates of sickness and travelling to Tranquebar and Tiruchirapalli.

Camerer is kind, remembers Mrs. Lascelles but assumes a very high tone in his

official capacity. Much talk about Missionary interference (concerning Mr. B's

stations). To dinner I feit obliged to repair to Capt. Perreau. I came then

near him; speaking about sin and the love of Christ; also the evil example of

Europeans: he sighed deeply. Recollections from his youth seem to make him an

unhappy sinner. He wished he had become a clergyman. I spoke about the compara-

tively greater temptations such as one has. Perhaps my words appeared to him

far more pointed than I thought - as it was only after I had taken farewell,

that I heard of his sinful life. - He wished me to see him also in future, if

I should feel any pleasure in coming to him. I wish to feel it an honour to

be with great sinners, only without the danger of encouraging them thereby.

(Er ist ein beständiger Ehebrecher - sonst ein sehr guter Mann, wie seine katho¬

lischen Diener sagen. Seine Frau und Kinder sind in England. Vielleicht hat

he also saw his broken leg as a punishment. I didn't think I would

of such causes I had to explain his fluent Tamul language

to have). In the evening went over to Kohl. Camerer left in Palankin for Bangalore

and Mysore. Spoke with Kohl, who is in a nice state of heart, but strangely

1838

23

deceived by a (Roman Catholic) natural sentiment for everything grand imposing

and mysterious, an inclination which his judgment justifies by mingling all

kinds of 0T1* notions with the spirit of the Old Testament. (No Lord's supper

except in church. [&lt;"&gt;]Sacraments^i(/y7'&gt;^g^ not to be brought to hear by continual

use, nor by laic administration. Allows his Catechist to baptize but only by

the priest's authority - whilst he has no discernment as to the character of

natives cfr. his miserable housekeeping. Public preaching immensely differing

from speaking in houses or family worship. He wishes even candles on the Lord's

suppertable, whether by day or by night. - Ministry 3 Orders, although in history

he allows t rSt-Vß» and sttiGK to mean one and the same thing). He agrees with

the difference of law and gospel but is frightened by many things he heard.

Archdeacon made him acting Chaplain at Vellore. He does not like it, but cannot

avoid it, wishes to learn Tamil but speaks with servants always English. (Klagte,

that Grooves has so much to do with the English and money for heathens

given, consume in their service. I said not the English, but

Construction (for pagans), have Gr[oves] so distracted). Capt. Awdry will introduce

him in the surrounding villages, Kohl gave me 2 South Indian repositories concern-

ing Miss[ion] work for Perr[eau], Rh[eniu]s' review for Kohl Gr's law and ministry

influence. Rh[eniu]'s letter. - Stood up with him till midnight. At 4 o'clock

left in his palankin and reached the bandi in Tencal

(Thursday, 8 February): formerly a large place, plenty of Muhammedan houses now stood as ruins.

After breakfast (in T[encal]) walked through the village. Few people took tracts

(Tamil). Entered into.a Tamil school where the boys from fear pretended not

to be able to read the books only their oleis; spoke with the men there, who

heard but could not read. Arrived about 10 at Arcot. Mrs. Bushby was present.

Walker came to dinner. Afterwards he complained very much about the want of

brotherly love amongst Christians and believes even there is more amongst worldly

men. Confesses that they all want an elder, because everyone distrusts each

other's abilities to explain the word of God. They all had hoped for Major Per-

thius*. Saw the Knox's. - Evening spoke with Chrfistian] Sam's brother, who

wishes to be baptized and with the Ayah, who complains of their being left now

without instruction. Whether we ought not to send Andrew sometimes over. Evening

we all came together (without More and Cumberledge) (read Hebr XII) after unprofit¬

able singing.

Friday, 9 February, morning later than I wished to Lalapetti. As I could not go myself into

the village I sent Vedamuttu with tracts and a gospel. He found some people

willing to hear, one wished a gospel. They were saying that they worship what

the Brahmins just teil them, at present a Goddess Mari, made of the 3 metals. -

Arrived about sunset in Poonay and walked alone into the village. People crowded

around me with twice the confidence they had the last time, took tracts and

heard. The Schoolmaster who asked me to sit in his verandah was the only overwise

one of them all, and said Jesus has spoken i V® &lt;x_y lies. I asked why? -

why, because Mr. Lascelles believes false witness and cannot find out the truth:

and so are all the Christians. They say they have the truth and can still not

distinguish between lies and truth. But he was angry that Government gave him,

such an able man and good Speaker, no / g u/ • * told him,

what a fool he was to call Chr[ist] a liae'wixhout knowing what he said and

to impute to Chrfist] all the shortcomings of his followers. He will now come

to Ch[ittoor] and get a large Telugu book to learn all these things. But perhaps

he seeks employment. The other people listened well and as my tracts did not

suffice, some followed me to the bungalow and took tracts there also. - Took

24

1838

tea with Wedamuttu and asked him about what I had observed - a kind of coldness

and emptiness that could not be hidden. It wasn't his wedding matter,

but distraction of the spirit, stimulated by much talking with servants

and the interruption of the biblical food which he so regularly ate at Ch[ittoor]

Has. Fr.* thinks he always suffers from travelling. I said it's not that

Travel but the lack of vigilance that all young Christians and I have

is also so dangerous; he also said he was often afraid of falling, like him

for 6 months after his first Christian resolutions in Palayankottai

Seminar gefallen sei, und nach dem Fallen sei das Aufstehen so viel schwerer.

Hatte liebliche Unterredung mit ihm: besonders über das Gebet für Leute vor

und nach der Besprechung.

Saturday, 10 February, before sunrise to Narsingarowpetti, where I drank coffee. The people

again as stiff as when I asked them the last time. My feeling is, they have

a bad impression from something past which I do not know. But the boys flocked

to me and gave me opportunity to speak through the books I gave them, also to

their parents. The Pariars (towards N) are willing to hear, but understand only

Telugu. - Arrived about 10 in Chittoor.

Christian's marriage on Wednesday, 7 February, quarrel of Reader Daniel with

Andrew about Church differences. Chr[istian] seems to have learned how to work

in his situation, from* Mr. Pettitt. They already speak of the glory of the

Society and their continual supply of labourers, etc., etc.

Sunday, 11 February. Baptized Fr. Lascelles of the Bazar bought Arthur; and Andr[ew] the two

Girls, Sarah and Mariah - the schoolmistress Ruth. - So far diary.

Sunday February 18th. After February 17 John Gr[oves] arrived here from Wellore and

furious!

March 5, Monday evening (no visits from the poor people . Examined the Ist dass of Mrs.

L[ascelles'] girls in Tamil grammar). To Vendamur: where a Mr. Elliots servants

had laid hold of the bungalow, made a dreadful row when we wanted a small place

of it, called V[edamuttu] sackili, because he came near their pots &lt;(Henry

Groves along)&gt; - so we went to the house of a Comedi where the bazarverandah

stood to our disposal. After H. had arrived we had tea and after tea a long

talk with a Brahmin who sat in the verandah, before several attentive people.

The question about schools, also seems to be renewed there, but nothing decided.

6. März, Tuesday. Pardarami before sunrise. In the northern village, where they formerly would

not even receive us, they now took tracts and talked pretty freely, especially

some Tamulians. In the village south now everything dumb, the Ganakupilley having

gone to Pallicondah. Had Hebrew and English scripture reading. At 3 over the

mountains to Calpadi where the people gathered as the last time und understood

very well what I said of man's fall and rise through Christ. I should think

some people there quite ready to give up idolatry. But one grieved me by alluding

to the dissension of the Roman Catholics as exhibited in Vellore shows at Christmas

(hanging plantains at the doors). - After tea one came for an Almanack or Calendar,

which gave me some opportunity to speak of the different worlds, of times past

and future. - Wir hatten Tee ohne Milch mit Eiern getrunken. Das wirkte so auf

my stomach that I woke up in the night with severe vomiting and with cholera

thought. The following dreams were frightening: the night an eternity. Strange,

that I have dreams full of serious memories at this sleeping place

- but these are also steps on the ladder to heaven. Very weak

morning 7 March, Joh.* Müller's* birthday after Gudiyattam. Had again many hearers in the village

near the bungalow: and some visitors in the bungalow (Muttusawmi). This village

is still the most universally interesting of those I am acquinted with. In the

afternoon we were in the villages north, especially with Mahratta Brahmins,

who dispised us greatly and feit a little uncomfortable about the things we

told the people around. Through many streets we went distributing tracts, and

giving occasionally explanations about the reason for our doing so. Also in

a large Telugu school, and to Moormen.

8 March, Thursday, early to Pallicondah, opposite to Mr. Ogilvie's tents in the bungalow. Went

after breakfast into the bazar to speak and to distribute tracts. Many Musulmen.

About Christ's incarnation, which I spoke of as the way in which God was pleased

to remove sin, a Mus[ulman] observed: so has God a material form? that is Tamil

Shastram! I said that God has it in his will to manifest himself in whatever

26

1838

form he wishes, only we the creatures are not allowed to confine God to this

or that form of our own invention. He gave no heed to this, but a proud Lingite

who at first had declined everything with smooth verses, seemed to get interested

in the talk and came afterwards for a gospel to the bungalow. Several children

also came there to fetch books. One of whom when I asked them seriously about

God and what his life consists in, said that indeed at daytime their Samis have

no life, but only at niqhttime . He added: "but I do not know this myself: the

great people who have seen it, teil so." - The day having passed (especially

in Persian conversations of Henry with the old Sepoy there), we went again through

the bazar on our way back to Gudiyattam, distributed many books, the children

pursued us even to the river. I only got them off by commanding the servant

to lift one in the bandi to take him along to Chittoor. In Gudiyattam a Colonel

had arrived (Col. Finkh) suffering from Podagra, the Peons said, he had questioned

them the day about God and things future: still we came in no contact with him,

having removed to the old bungalow.

9 March, Friday. Went early over the mountains back to Samireddipalli, a Telugu village (at

late hour, for the bandi had hard work, and was twice to be seen the wheel on

the top). Drank coffee there. Found the accountant teaching the Telugu letters

to 6 children. He liked to enter into conversation, was glad that there is no

idol in their village and believed a God in the heart, but could hardly believe

that this God will hear if we cry. Old women stood around us, while we talked

together, and wondered and nodded when I called God father, them children, and

explained what consequences follow from this. He took tracts, so also did two

other men, a Telugu and a Moorman. - Dinner at Pardarami. - Cloudy afternoon

to Caseral, a village of Ideer, Pariar, Paneiar, in 3 divisions. With the latter

we took our abode in a shelter for drying fruits. Hardly any Tamil spoken,

nor Telugu read in both villages. To the accountant's son, who reads a little,

I gave Tamil and Telugu tracts to be delivered to his father when he comes home.

10 March, Saturday. Home by way of Iruvaram where we drank our coffee and saw the school with

some people

Sunday. Pellews here and Brett and Purton at Lord's supper.

Monday, March 12th. Lazar's wife accused by Papa of adultery, the latter being the only witness,

after having had quarrel about rice. Circumstances rather prove the contrary,

although she showed herseif to be uncautious in her behavior towards men, more

perhaps from foolishness than from uncontrolled lusts. - Also this Monday

the women did not come - probably because Mrs. Groves calls them on Monday too:

and Ramasami after his way won't let her come to me.

17 March, Saturday. Heard that Emma was dating Lieut. Walker from Arcot promised what I really like

delighted. The Lord has thus put an end to the evil story with Frank, and

as I think, everything is lovingly prepared for the benefit of the 2 siblings.?

March 18th. Since Butschi, one of the women, told me today that Mrs. Groves was calling her too

On Monday, I requested an interview with Mrs. Groves, in which I

said everything outright. All your enmity towards me stems from jealousy

1. from the thought that I love the Johns more than they do, which Parnell says,

2. From a feeling that I am ready to do anything for her that she asks me

but please also offer me service for Mrs. Lascelles. She confessed to some

fault that she is inherently dictatorial and not pleasant, etc., and she

In the last week of March new trouble because of the girls' schools. The parents discontent of

many little things and stimulated by hope of money and fields through the new

friend of Mr. B. the Socinian Lewin, as well as by Anei, who wanted to revenge

herseif of Mrs. Lascelles having discontinued her excess of kindness towards

her. Wanted their children and turned mostly to Bilderbeck. So we have less

care. But Mr. Lewin as already about to depart again, his wife being sick on

the hills. New plan introduced the

Tuesday, 3 April, to Patnam, walked to and fro in a hot day, which brought me a fever, but found

nice people and really desirous after a school although I should oppose their

religion. - The Purtons are going owing to Madras (for Coimbatore).

9 April, Monday, to Vellore, on horseback, passed the night in the bungalow, arrived at Vellore

morning 8 o'clock. Dear Kohl had been affected in the liver. Stood with him,

read, spoke, helped him also a little in the servants' management.

Wednesday, 11 April, went morning with him into a heathen school just begun near the entrance

of the bazar - quite out of Order, in consequence of his illness. Preached there

to the people, of whom some took tracts also: one cried out, yes this is a true

and righteous religion. (In the evening of Tuesday the Cat[echist] had a long

talk with me about Sabbath law, human nature of Christ, Groves and Cronin -

all the miserable consequences of B's loveless calumnies). Evening to another

Roman Catholic school - this is interesting. The boys reading Catholic legends,

still there are many regularly together and some answered my gueries with

intelligence although without the slightest knowledge of Christ. Here also some-

thing could be preached to the surrounding Roman Catholics of whom one was just

about to atone for a sin with the wax candle in the hand. - At midnight

Dr. Cumming called me out of bed to see a poor officer's corpse (Buee). He

seems to have died by an apoplectic stroke in conseguence of drinking. Saw

there dear Br. Bisset, and spoke some few words with him and to the countryborn

near him. All endeavours to revive the dead proved vain. The servants related

his last struggle in an awful way. - I had no sleep that night, and the fever

returned. So I could not make visits in the morning. Ottley came to see me,

evidently shaken by the death of his comrade. Düring the day I took medicine,

and left Kohl when he was just preparing to go to the burial. - Reached the

bungalow about 9 o'clock with trouble. The Lord sent a heavy rain and tempest

that hung over me, to another direction, and so I had only a few drops and

the wind on the back. Awoke in the morning at 3, and arrived at sunrise,

thoroughly fatigued, in Ch[ittoor], The Lord's mercy be praised which taught

me many things on the way, also practically explained to me why the litany

prays "keep us from evil sudden death". - Saw in Kohl the evil of a solitary

Missionary.

April 15, Easter. The Lord opened my mouth to me in the morning, the miracle of his resurrection

to proclaim. I explained why the disciples didn't understand the Scriptures

who everywhere preaches of life out of death by means of faith in death (Jonah, David,

Daniel etc.). That the disciples of Christ's faith should not exalt

conclusions is a striking sign of their still very pagan mind.

The disciple whom Jesus loved believed . 1 Cor 15 also shows that faith

tearing one out of paganism, faith in Christ is risen.

It also enables one to die alone with Christ. - Afternoon, Vedamuttu

the Lord sanctify it. Poor heart, how deeply intertwined you are

into the body of sin and death, and how difficult it is not often to be foreign

Saturday 21st evening. Hear today that Mr. Start stayed with my father for a few days and

hit him well. It is bitter to receive such poor news from him.

- After Ms Lascelles told me more about Julie's booth on Sunday Quasimodogeniti

and challenges, it's fitting for me - as I think they

better anticipate the future. May the Lord test and guide me.

the Tamil Aber lahl, Julie asked me with great composure regarding the letter

she was saddened that Mrs. Groves had told her so.

For no sooner had Julie answered that one had to pray about it than Frau pointed it out

Groves almost dismissed him with contempt, didn't show her the letter, almost forced it

an instant no. And before I go to bed, Groves comes up to me and says

with exultation, as Julie, almost without thinking, said no and

didn't even consider the thought. That's the lying spirit again

who spares no personality. Groves seems selfish

regarding Julie's loss of awareness and says he argues against it.

- But it is bitter to have become so completely the property of others,

Mrs. Lascelles talked to me about it the next day after the school exam

do it to the Lord to marry Julie if only I had letters from home and

I beg you, let your mercy hold me, that satan not over me

and laugh at all my feeble doings.

Kohl came over from Vellore on Friday mornings, visited the Groves on Friday evenings, left on Sundays

not to church.

Monday, May 21st. At 2 o'clock in the morning he went on to Palmaner. A little brother of Mrs. Bisset,

Richard Coxton was with him. Cabbage through smoking, drinking, resting, isolation

almost bloated and worn out in body and soul. Sad visit.

Wednesday May 23rd. Mrs. Groves showed her reluctance in a new way by [&lt;with&gt;]

George and Frank Lascelles and drove off about my absence because

as a result, the boys' school was neglected. Because it has come to an end

with the pointless connection in which Mrs. Groves Isabell with herself and

wanted to hold on to the school. She decided with ft &lt; r *ZO ta n

X c _„ o~&lt;~f • Erau Groves punished with confinement, I redeemed them from it,

and the girls school. Lascelles told me all this openly and offered money

I don't know yet how to go.

that I don't think our connection can last any longer than it used to

I will not leave India. It seems to have affected him greatly

yet he spoke of it in a sweet spirit, avoiding how

I also expected to question myself about the reasons.

Saturday 26th Vedamuttu said that if he behaved so arrogantly as to break away from us

that in 2 or 3 days there will be humiliation or release. In the evening he came

humbly and said he only ( \/ nco ) said it in too many confidences

on his wife. I said there must be a formal apology.

Sunday 27th he and his wife did not come to church. Had George the halfcast on the

Monday morning, 28th, Vedamuttu came to me and Groves and admitted his mistakes, whether des salaries

because I don't know yet. He wept: confessed that he was much to blame from the start

on me: I told him how I thought him so intoxicated with new honours

after* eating* the flesh, I do not know whether there is any spirit left

being alive. That I prefer heathen schoolmasters to professed Christians,

thus becoming the proverb of the servants. He wanted us everything

forget, but there is a difference between forgiving and forgetting!

Friday, June 1st, A. told me that Vedamuttu was with catechist Peter and through him with Bilderbeck

entered into negotiations from the moment I spoke of dismissal

have. Therefore he did not come to communion on June 3: in his place were Penina,

Anema, Charles, Josephine present, along with Magdl's grandfather (don't forget him

and his son Salomon, formerly jailpeon, who does not yet know of rebirth).

After the Abena meal, Andr. away. Monday morning sued Vedamuttu A's sister,

that she set aside rice and curry stuff, sell it, and already have one for herself

bought ring. Even if it is true, only Vedamuttu has it

done out of envy (A. and his sister were given clothes) and with

real fear only after A. left.

Thursday last May 31, awful occurrence in Madras. Walker breaks the connection with E.

off on the morning of the marriage, pretendingly because she had not told him

that her father had been an innkeeper on the Isle of Wight, which he himself

had kept her from doing saying upon her "he was in business". Do you believe

and the place crowded full. Lord, bless the words spoken in weakness.

Monday 18 June. Baynes and I clashed, as he distrusted one of my words, me

asked if I had been to the Lascelles. I told him straight out

that I do not consider him guilty, but only the instrument of a more important one

spirit. - Baynes delights in the lies his catechists tell of Sophia,

our Ambros, old woman picked up. These lies bring Mgd. with vira,

Strai with Vedamuttu etc. together. - Oh Lord, protect the children from uncleanness.

I couldn't help but tell him how his vulnerability made it impossible for me to

make say a word. He said - and proudly, I'm afraid - it was

true, he was wounded, and that because he took me for his censor. end of

whole interview that he thought I hated him, Groves, but that he did anyway

know that his wife only spoke of me with the greatest love and respect,

never met me with a single word. He realized his mistake

on that he never spoke out against me and that he was not Tamil with me

started.

Saturday evening Elizabeth's sad condition (her tali torn by her husband, she cast out,

because of baptism) discussed. Chastised by Lascelles, he accepted her again.

Sunday morning, June 23, Mrs. Groves spoke about my charges, also said flatly that she knew

nothing, but is friendly: and so the Lord blesses the farewell.

Saturday June 30th. Sent A. to Vedamuttu to decide. He doesn't want to stay except

for high salary. So that was decided. - Also a bitter heel prick,

full of ingratitude and cunning cunning. We want to try it now with Siva Rettinam.

- In the evening there was a clash because I went to Tirunelveli for a catechist

for which Lascelles had written without prior consultation. Miss Lascelles

had expressed it against Ms. Groves, since she expressed annoyance that

Saturday 14 July went to the Lascelles early in the morning and told them everything. Afterwards came Groves

there; and came home in tears at Lascelle's frankness. I told Groves he

I would like to speak to Julie now, he did and came home with a yes. Then wish

I to see her and Groves took her to the bungalow where I saw her outright

Thursday, July 26, I had my first trials of married life and learned to give thanks to God

has opened our eyes and hearts to one another so that we can freely look at one another

and hope in the Lord, to be able to present all of our concerns to him.

Elisa, Urani, Titus 2 children Isaak and Anna, John* Howes child Mari baptized,

Vedamuttu also feels entirely free of Groves. The mission is in turmoil

Grove 's impatient, ruthless behavior toward Julie's Soll

Gnanamuttu who was taken into the bungalow, his granddaughter Margaret, the schoolmistress

Ruth. I'm afraid it won't be a year before the mission falls apart

Groves now experienced the same thing that Rhenius did from Tucker, because I felt that way beforehand

much about Tucker and CMS. Ah, there are so many companies

more man's work than this gibberish of the Groves etc. I am free of him now,

free through bitter, heart-rending experiences, must those who approach me

have closed, put into the hands of a stranger, and do everything as finely as

as if I hadn't even a thought that I had more right to her than

Groves who never worked on them. I gotta see the kids and everyone

almost desperately want to hold on to us because they are in front of the ^

I come to the last prayer. (Lascelles and Brett). 4 1/2 off for Nararipetti

Tuesday, 31 July. Morning at Vellore. Kohl received us with all his heartfelt politeness.

Major Purtons, when I visited them, were very kind. Evening a walk towards

the fort and consultation whether Kohl should make use of his sick-oertificate

to leave for the Straits and China, or stay and marry?

Wednesday, 1 August, early to Pallicondah. Evening preaching in Bazar and books distributed,

especially gospels to Mohammedan Schoolmasters. Found the former visit not

forgotten, books kept and read.

Thursday, 2 August. From 4 - 12 on the road to Ambur - 19 long miles. The way turns out of the

Palar valley between mountains of somewhat more European appearance than those

at Chittoor. First Palmyra top - afterwards fine wet and dry cultivation. In

Ambur one countryborn Tappalwriter came for tracts, told of more than 40 Roman

Catholic families in a village near. On the bazar many Muselmen* very desirous

after books. Among the Heathens a Brahmin judged very hardly about the money

robbing God preaching white men, whom I then showed that he ought rather first

to hear than to speak. I was nearly besieged in the bungalow for books. A

candidate for baptism with the Roman Catholics and a Roman Catholic halfcast

came also for Gospels to whom in the presence of a Mohammedan I spoke about

Christ's birth and youth and growth without apparently offending the Mohammedan.

Friday, 3 August, early arrived in Vaniyambadi, large village consisting of 5. People at first

shy. A Brahmin boy scoffing. But after one had taken books all strov. to get

them and came also to the bungalows.

Saturday, 4 August. Tiruppattur many pagodas. People by Missionaries prepared for reception

of books and hearing. Roman Catholic beggars with great professions.

Sunday, 3 August. Mattur. There came a man here to me, somewhat stirred up to enquiry by a tract

given by Mr. Addis, 6 months ago. He did not keep the contents well, but

remembered the gentleman had said these are books, conducive for heaven.

Mr. Stonehouse passing through in the evening.

Monday, 6 August. Irumalur after passing the Ponnaiyar already more Canarese. 2 men came, one

formerly with Mr. Crisp in Salem. Care for livelihood more than for knowledge.

Tuesday, 7, through Dharmapuri, large native town with a few Subaltern European Magistrates,

old fort. Christian School exhibited on the bazar.

Wednesday, 8, from Adamankottai (where many Roman Catholic Churches with schools and a Roman

Catholic Peon asking for books for his son) through Toppur pass. I was riding

on the (h and arrived in the village, waited long for my lady, tili

Siva Rettinam came -shd of the breaking of the bandi related. Met my lady 2

after noon walking. The bandi brought by 8 coolis.

Thursday, 9, bandi etc. removed to Omalur, my wife sitting on the samanbandi. No mender to

be found.

Friday, 10 August, after a new rainy night to Salem, where we had sent the bandi before to

Rev. G. Waltog. Most friendly reception. The native Catechists sat for several

hours together with me, talking and hearing. Feast for Mr. and Mrs. return.

Union and familiarity with the natives, furthered by the keeping aloft of the

Saturday, 11, Munchavadi. Sepoys do not read, Brahmins not receive. The saltpetre-miners

required. One boy knew the whole criticisms 1 chapter by heart (Telugu).

schoolmaster among his children who took 2 books.

13. August. Julie sieht im Traum Kränze um des Vaters Leiche. Srigambur. A thief is detected

in stealing our bedsheet. But we did not deliver him over to the judge.

16 August, Thursday morning passed Coleroon and Cauvery. Tiruchirapalli Miss Lloyd soon arrived

after our arrival in Schreyvogel's house and brought me letters. Schreyvogel

and M. have applied to the CMS. This sounds rather astonishing. But as our father

has counted the sparrows he has also counted our days and stages. We could

Don't stay at Tiruchirapalli to wait for an answer. So we go on to Tirunelveli

only for a visit, no more for participation in labour. The anxiety we cast on

thee, who for us hast had so many anxieties already, dear Lord and Savior! -

Schreyvogel from Lindau. Schmitz from Berlin born 18 May 1816, careless.

Mission schools etc. expensive, built by the government, but no life.

Schreyvogel boasts that he knocked down castes: besides that he has them

Germans to give him money (1,000 thalers a year) for so-called

Hallian institutions, which are under the supervision of the bishop but not of society

should stand.

Left 17 August, Eriday, very late, all the servants unwilling to go, nothing prepared although

Sorry if he should have offended anyone.

Thursday morning the 24th I went to Pattamar. Farewell to my wife how much

Time to examine the boys who always stood around me. The answers

they prefer to appear ignorant. Before going to bed the merchant said as

of course - at 11 o'clock. Inquiring conversations - roughest historical and bib¬

Morning February 3rd. I had to go for a walk in the plantation with John in the morning. Without a question

he made everyone come to church: i said michael had 8 o'clock with me yesterday

turned off. Yes, that's supposed to be 8 o'clock. Meanwhile, the people were together

and as we walked on, Michael made a short speech. I left at 8 o'clock

up and spoke about rebirth (caste. Seeds of animals and plants, ent

against the mere change of religion, dress and other). Everyone heard that

Parables I brought up (of the king in Tanjore) attentively. Many

serious faces - also careless and dull ones. - Afterwards I called Michael

for a private conversation. But his masters instructed him now he must praise them,

say nothing against them, etc. Michael came to my room and was overheard

That's where I went. Terrible openings! Easter 35 Michael was sent

10-1, then 11-1, then 11 1/2 to 1, then 12-1, through much remonstrating again

11 1/2 to 1. The good seed took root, then persecution. The overseers of

Slaves embittered at their firm stand against lusts of the flesh.

October 37 went the European. Now the fornication devil was loose. No consideration

on age, place, time, the reluctant defeated, one died. quite a few who

jumped away, were without maintenance. Everyone in the neighborhood was afraid

to insult the Browns, since they win every trial by false witnesses

(Tier's wife): fell into bad hands again because they were young. the

Schoolboys once examined by George Brown replied via Vibasaramy -

Christ said differently than he did, not stealing, lying, underhand work, but after

lusting after a woman etc. is adultery. The curses and judgments of adulterers

in Malayalam - leaflets placed in the Lord's Way. The catechist is zealous. -

Strikes and new pursuit. Many boys and young men want to jump away

but they fear that the catechist will only have it worse if he stays that way

you. He also wants to leave, but is afraid of Jonas' fate. Since Rhenius

death he was treated utterly as a servant abandoned by all masters, they believe

he only stays because of the salary. Sometimes to Cannanore. - Da West for a visit

wrote, visiting Cannanore in free hours was forbidden, slaves were allowed

do not equal masters. Nevertheless it goes on. One would have the catechist

dismissed, one was not afraid of the European. Lots of false accusations

the servant against him. - We were not alone, the boys heard deeply saddened

Sunday is payday, nothing heard but laughter, scolding, rupee rattling. -

At dinner it was said that the work was not all done, so renewed rupee

counted, and drunkenness among those who were paid. The gentlemen held

that for innocent amusement. I went over the hill to the des

Catechists house, didn't find him, he had gone to the village. That's where I went

also, found slaves of the neighborhood gathered around him to hear the word. Although

April 13, 1939. The brothers Gundert (with his wife) and Dehlinger are on April morning

departed from Mangalore on behalf of the General Conference and on April 12th

Arrived at Tellicherry in the afternoon, intending to, in that of Mr. Strange

Decided

1. Brother Gundert to be stationmaster and librarian-

2. Brother Dehlinger is to be station recorder^archivist and station cashier.

3. The Gundert siblings keep house.

April 14, Lugard baptizes Butler Emanuel's children. (March 2nd, Emanuel &lt; Tschadeappen).

service in English (11 a.m.) has started this morning.

In the evening hour of edification in the house of a native Protestant. (Jes. Schmidt,

son of a German soldier).

April, 30th. It was decided: Brother Dehlinger should go to Mangalore with Brother Mögling and from there to

Dharwar travel. An attack of dysentery that began in Mangalore and is still going on here

was neglected has weakened his health so much that the local doctor

a stay on the coast during the upcoming monsoon for quite

explained inadvisably. This is also Br. Dehlinger's and our view. Since the

- recommended - trip to the Nilgiris and the stay there to Brother Dehlinger

would be too arduous and costly, we believe that Dharwar or Hubli

the most suitable place for him because of the climate and other favorable circumstances

will be. Thursday May 2nd is scheduled to depart for Mangalore.

(The 2 brothers went ashore May 4th, Saturday).

May 3rd. As a result of letters from Mr. Tucker, Mr. Lugard has the local church to the Civil

Tellicherry, June 1, 1839. Honorable Committee!

By decree of the General Conference of your West Coast missionaries

from India should first give you a report from the Tellicherry station

to have been sent to the June steamboat. The accelerated departure of this Dampf¬

boots has unexpectedly made it impossible to issue the same,

ln the hope that you will take the little news with forbearance,

which can be given about a work that is only just beginning, is now the

present report written and sent to the northern stations, by

from where he might take a steamboat to the Persian Gulf

can be transported.

1. The brothers Gundert and Dehlinger followed the resolutions of the General Conference

According to April 11 from Mangalore to Tellicherry to meet Mr. Strange

Her mission gifted home a mission station for the Malayalam people

to justify. By the grace of the Lord they arrived safely on April 12th

and were soon settled in their new residence, since Mr. Strange

However, when she was learning the Malayalam language, Mangalore was a start

to force her away from the desk and into bed. After Br. Mögling (for the baptism of a

was, the visibly deteriorating condition of the ill brother made one

Advice needed on what to do in such circumstances. The doctor advised

for a hasty journey to the Nilgiris before the monsoon breaks all

make recovery on this coast impossible. Since our part from Dharwar

and Hubli was mentioned, he considered the local climate even more advisable

than that of the Nilgiris. As a result, Brother Dehlinger made friends with Brother Mögling

on his way to Mangalore (May 4), where he passed May 7, still very weak,

arrived. By this serious coincidence, the new station is deprived of a worker

been, whose whole heart was in this work: and the deliberations since then

Your general conference has not yet developed into a rash that

gave reason to hope that this station would soon be completely occupied.

From this you can easily conclude with what desire we all of Aus¬

look forward to sending new brothers.

2. 3. Because Brother Gundert spent the past month of May almost exclusively

occupied with learning the Malayalam language, there was no time for missionary work

preaches left, even if he should have trusted himself, with public

talk in that language to make a start.

4. A fairly wide field is already open here for pastoral care. Under the

significant number of Indo-Brits and Indo-Portuguese are also some pro¬

Testant families who [decide] about the establishment of a mission station

here and look forward to home visits. One of them, Schmidt, son of a German

sincere, though none may be called confidently converted

is repeatedly visited, especially in cases of illness, where among the numerous

residents and visitors to speak many a salutary word from the gospel. -

For the servants, which consists almost entirely of Tamil Christians, in regel¬

moderate evening prayers read and explained a harmony of the gospels. Of the

Tobias, recently baptized in Mangalore, has an open ear for the truth.

He and the other servants have been encouraged to work daily in the Malayalam

School to learn to read in order to prepare for the upcoming change of worship

to be prepared for the language used. &lt;Regular Tamil sermon on Sundays.&gt;

5. Mission house visits are by name since the beginning of the rainy season

become very rare. But from time to time some natives come

partly taught in the earlier mission schools which tracts

seek and speak Malayalam with for fortune.

6. Catechists are promised by the Tirunelveli brothers, but not yet

have been sent. Br. Müller wants a boy educated in the seminary there

send a man bold to come hither. Brother Schaffter wants to

to send one or two qualified workers if they can be found willingly.

Michael, the Anjerkandi catechist, has repeated visits to the mission house

paid off and gives rather encouraging reports on the progress of that there

works. His masters show more willingness than before to spread Christian

Acknowledgment to do since the prospect of more regular visits

missionaries is present.

7. At the request of the English officials, English services are on Sundays

started in the morning and has continued without interruption since April 28th

but expecting that the bishop will do so soon, the chaplain has the

An hour of edification at the home of the aforementioned Mr. Schmidt on Thursday evening

been started, to which about 18 listeners, including Catholics, come.

8. The English school here, which was opened last June by contributions from the

population was reestablished under the old schoolmaster Baptiste,

after the ecclesiastical mission she gave up several years earlier, by

about 50 boys and 6 girls attended. The mission is responsible for overseeing it

been transferred. Thursday is the day for visiting and examining the school

appointed day. Most of the boys are Catholics, the minority are pagans. -

On Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons, about 10 of the more advanced come to the

Mission house, where they receive geography lessons. Several of the girls

come on clear afternoons to learn handwork from Sister Gundert.

9. In the middle of May there is a Malayalam school in the wide porch of the missionary

house has been opened. The school started with about 10 boys, including 3 girls

of the servants and those servants who are learning to read Malayalam

want. The schoolmaster is a young Hindu educated in Baptiste's school,

without great gifts, but willing to teach our Christian books to read.

4 of the boys, who are fairly finished reading, are talked about daily by Brother Gundert

what has been read catechized, in the presence of the munchis.

11. Concerning the economy it is to be noted that the distance of the house from

of the city, the incomplete furnishing of the new buildings and the

Extent of the estate over quite a stretch of fertile land especially

until the beginning of the rainy season caused all sorts of care and work. Should

Of course, as long as only one missionary brother is here, this capital must remain unused

relevant worries, most of which fall on Sister Gundert, are over

Appealed to the Mission House, the wives of Judges Anderson and Harris

be laid, by sending victuals, equipment and workers

to provide all possible assistance.

12. On the whole it is striking how willing the English are here to

to promote the started mission station. The departure of Brother Dehlinger

has aroused sincere sympathy from most. Also in the neighborhood

in Cannanore, as well as among the missionaries in the south of the country, has the establishment

given the new station cause for thanks and expressions of joy. may the lord

because soon many workers will be sent into this wide field! may he especially you,

Distinguished committee, give boldness, before the next rainy season a number

fresh missionary brothers to the weakly manned stations of this coast

to send.

Tellicherry

Mid November 13th.

Dear Committee! This is the 2nd report brought to you by the new

Tellicherry station is sent. Summarizing it, I thank that

Lord, who up to now has kept us in his mercy discipline, I am also ashamed,

that on our part so little can be said in praise of His efficacious grace. we

are in the subjects of work as templates from the beginning, with little change

continued, not as if we had the undoubted conviction that these

Working methods would have to prove themselves successfully, but because we are not hin¬

felt the calling to invite new attempts. Once several

more brothers will have settled in Malayahlam land it is

on the Lord to show us new ways and give us unanimous boldness,

that we can respond to them.

1. So far none of the brothers have been associated with me. In May several had

Brethren suggested sending Br. Vinegar to Tellicherry, and over

August, since other brothers wished for Brother Essig's transfer to Dharwar

thought it was worth, Tellicherry protested against it. But both times

was decided by the majority that the Malayalam station temporarily

having to be patient with a worker until reinforcements are sent from you.

Meanwhile we are in August - September due to a visit by Brother Hiller (see § 11)

in October - November through Br. Sutter's stay of several weeks, as well as

November 9 through a half-day* objection from Br. Greiner (on his return

journey from the Nilgiris to the northern stations) not only delighted but

also been assured that the remaining brothers would appreciate the reinforcement of the Malayalam

Mission right at heart. The Lord gave us our health

with few changes, showed that he had failed in our work

put up with it for the time being - and if he wants to have done more here, he will

he himself will soon be able to employ more and better workers.

2. Travel . The location of Tellicherry station (6 hours from Cannanore, 4^_5 hours

from Anjerkandi, 2 hours from Mae, 13 hours from Calicut) seemed long enough

to give up my job, to leave the house of my dear wife for a short time

and establish or maintain connections in the area. With Anjerkandi

a more regular connection has not yet been put into operation.

I have repeatedly examined the school there and with different ones

to praise the landowners there - by cutting bamboo for us on their territory

always waiting for a clearer calling before we go into the mission field there

be able to act more decisively: and I have hope that this will help us with the

forthcoming return of the European Mr. Brown will be granted. -

I have visited Cannanore 5 times. There is a small Tamul church there

without a teacher to whom I preached at various times. I checked too

Mr. Capl. Lugard's wish the baptismal candidates presented to him, which I of

found the unappointed teachers there very badly informed. One from Mr

is now on the lst Monday of every month mission prayer time in the chapel there,

what the Christian friends there with many European soldiers

arrived for the first time on October 7th. On November 4th was also a pool

announced, in which more than 24 Rs (partly in very small donations) fell.

The Lord wants this beginning of Christian prayer fellowship to be near

continue to bless. -

The visits to Calicut (September 23 with Brother Hiller to buy wood, November 5

with Brother Sutter on a visit) were too short to say much about it

let. The population of the city is posted to 100 000, of which against

40,000 Mohammedan descendants of Arabs, and a large number of

Portuguese and native Catholics. We were before our eyes as the Heu¬

terrify etc. But if the Lord is with us and we don't fear, we will

he will bring us to the same land. - On the last trip I had

step, but only moved closer to the one assigned to us. The moving ones

financial reasons see § 11.

3. The missionary preaching here was regularly provided only in August. I started

back then in the evenings, distributing tracts in the bazaar and with the bystanders

to speak. Whatever the gift of others, I've never had much joy

bility to this kind of work - for what is it here? My show is already collecting

a bunch, I begin to speak, the Mohammedans, which the plural

make out at the bazaar, yell at me, mock my speech impediments,

and consequently quiet, civilized, and perhaps inquiring men endure

far from me, and idle boys and marketeers surround me. In September went

I only go there once, never in October. I think through the first visits

to have achieved a purpose, namely that everyone now knows me as a teacher

of the new way - but don't think that many 100 more sermons any

would give anyone a proper notion of this new way. meanwhile leads

The service was held in Malayalam in June. The life of Jesus became

from Mangalore desiring to be baptized but having some work to do

was stopped - the old caste spirit revolted, he said he had come

to learn and then to become a teacher - and since I have neither rice nor teaching

wanted to give, unless he worked here or somewhere else, he left.

3. We used to have few visits to the mission house: the visitors had on

to pay a penny for the bridge over the Nettur River, and it was a long way.

But from time to time animals (coconut farmers) came from their nearby farms,

also employed natives from the city: all more or less curious,

most with easy-to-guess or openly stated sub-plots.

Since we've been living in the city, we've been visited more often, especially by

Many visitors wish to receive recommendations from us to the authorities

further and is available for the next work to come.

b) Gnanamuttu, Tirunelveli seminarian, the Br. Mögling because of pride from the

auxiliary work at the institute removed, entered here on July 27th

from the fact that they married heathen women - the

Temptations to fight arrogance as to his fairly independent position

easily entails. He has always had communion with Capl. in Cannanore

taken, though he is as near to Tellicherry as to Cannanore.

7. English sermons on Sundays have hitherto been properly observed.

The hour of edification with the Indobritons Thursday evening could after departure

of the (Christian) judge in the former restaurant are not continued: since

on his return (October) she will be [in] &lt;our city apartment&gt; diligently attended.

They consider this a recommendation for writer's and other promotions.

8. In the English school the Thursday visitation and instruction of the

high classes continued regularly in the afternoons. The house change has

now made a change possible, as a result of which the whole girls' school

(18 daysscholars) was handed over to Mrs. Gundert. The girls are studying now

in the mission house &lt;from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.&gt; Read and write English (native Malayalam),

Bible, arithmetic and manual work. She and the mothers seem quite happy about

to be our descent. - I teach in the school closest to the mission house

is still being paid by Ms. Anderson, 1-3 hours of English daily

Grammar, geography and biblical history.

9. The Malayalam School in the Veranda was maintained until October. The number

the boy once rose to 40, but usually stayed between 20-30.

About 15 have memorized a Malayalam catechism and several tracts

(Creation, Deluge, Tahiti Missionary History). The schoolmaster

institute which Sister Gundert was commissioned to start in Tellicherry,

now has 8 girls, 7 of whom are orphans. We had 10 for some time,

once 11, but the parents took the children back for various reasons.

We don't want to prevent this either and try above all to have children

to which nobody claims. The 4 oldest now have decent tips

learned to do work, so that over time they could make a living from it

can get hold of. The 2 most hardworking, Eliza and Francisca make us

They all behave well, but are very different in talents. The best

will perhaps be able to complete their studies in Mangalore.

11. Economics. The earlier house with many gifts caused several extraordinary

other expenses, as the station bill shows. Housekeeping expenses

were in 6 1/2 months for us (with the brothers Dehlinger, Hiller, Sutter,

each for one month) 542 Rs, of which 292 1/2 for actual housekeeping,

249 1/2 for servants. The latter cost so much because of the distance from the house

64

1839

and the expansion of the estate required some extraordinary servants: the

the former sum being explained by several visits from gentlemen and families,

which the beautiful location of the house invited. Roofing and other repairs

cost Rs 134. The buildings, which amounted to around Rs 306, passed

in 2 living rooms cut out of a veranda (for future brothers),

in catechists' apartments and a school for the girls (these 142 1/4 Rs).

Mrs. Harris had promised to pay the latter, but since this dear

Family now occupies the house (thus benefiting from the above constructions)

and give monthly 50 Rs house rent, to which they add 50 Rs contributions every month

promised, we could not charge them for the cost of that building. It stands

temporarily unused. This is of course a pity, but we did not believe ourselves

through such considerations from the house which the Lord inevitably entrusted to us

to be allowed to change. Rather, we want to become smarter through it

and think about it more in the future. Our balance is Rs 632 1/2 (NB of which

Rs 254 is a Swiss donation received from Mr. Büchelen. The costs

of the girls' institute, which amount to nearly Rs 97, we want the donors

as paid hereby). Since our house rate is only Rs 15,

we also have a few extra issues to expect, we believe in the upcoming one

accounting year with balance, house interest and contributions.

12. Much more could be said, but space and time urge me to be brief.

Since I am also learning Sanskrit with my current Munschi in addition to Malayalam

and now, with his help, has become quite proficient in reading

I didn't want to let this go unnoticed. This man I monthly

etc., it seems to me far better if he learns to speak and read it here

at the same time that he learns to copy it in European colleges. With his

I also wrote a Malayalam grammar for help, the future brothers

may be useful. Besides, I think little of learned missionaries for India.

Mr. Baber, 40 years in the service of the Cpgni [Compagnie], believes Moravians

would be the people for India: he wants me by the mountain tribes he first

conquered and made friends, introduce - already made acquaintance -

and wishes that non-gentlemen, the sawmills and other such businesses

be able to put into work, settle down among the people. He has us here

to set up a press which we promised for Tulu and Malayalam tracts

and fonts really need. About this and all we hope for more

even if he doesn't say it, has such ideas about me, that's how it is

Only general harmony of the 6.7.8.9. Punkts can make me stay.

Compound had occurred. The dates alternate between February and April (where

she helped to build a pen on the way to school). What is certain is that her mother

and she lived in Catiroor that Chinnappen visited her there

(he: twice on the occasion of taluk business, without sitting down to

set right about the bad rumor), (other three times, and that he there

the man fears to understand himself for the sake of caste. - After with

Chinnappen seriously, why I don't talk to him and that I want the truth,

but don't expect from him. I won't let him finish when he wants to say

that nothing but this had happened since his marriage. - Comes in the afternoon

he was found fit to serve the Lord as a catechist and showed in

this ministry to the end much zeal and patience, a love for sinners and

Willingness to suffer reproach for the Lord's sake, which has often put us to shame.

His course was short, and soon the Lord completed this dear brother and took

him to himself. Before all the world we can give him the testimony that he us, so

and his only concern now is how to take care of his wife and children

of the peace he now enjoys. The latter know nothing of him,

since he has been here, and naturally believe he is on a pilgrimage.

He longs to see them and tell them what has become of him,

even if they agree to bring them, but is in the opposite case

also quite willing to leave them for Jesus' sake. After the baptism we celebrated

to have fallen to a woman. S. Müller fell the same day. He had through his

Conversations contributed to all this slovenliness, but something in Gulady

of Kullen's case, H[aller] let the truth of the so-called Hei¬

leagues despair. H[aller] then met with M[üller], who told him

his falling, Hallers heard in return. M[üller] told about this Lenz

thing in Dharwar and afterwards said to H[aller] that Kaufmann knew about it. There heard

then that M[üller] had said it badly - he was in despair,

wanted to leave, in an open forest position, which M[üller] had suggested to him beforehand

had to wear. Würth seems to have given him the best advice. He wanted special

to have grieved for the shame of Christ's cause, not for himself,

also worried about falling into sin when alone in the forest. M[üller] has of his

Knechte heard that woman inquired of him at Yelwall and Andeu¬

services. M[üller] dismissed these people. But let it be hidden now
